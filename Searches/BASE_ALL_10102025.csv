The species is also believed to have culture potential and accordingly control over reproduction is considered valuable. The major purpose of the study was to accelerate gonad development resulting in spawning outside the natural spawning season. Abalone were collected from Franklin sound in the Furneaux group of islands off the north-east tip of Tasmania. The important features of the conditioning tank were elevated water temperature, the provision of water movement within the tank to distribute feed to sedentary abalone and a diet of preferred red algae. Animals collected on 27 April 1990 were induced to spawn on 21 August 1990, 112 days or 1750 degree days following commencement of gonad conditioning. The natural spawning season of the source population was found to be November to March. A variety of methods for measuring reproductive development of abalone were used. This allowed the utility of ...","2023","2025-10-09 23:52:36","2025-10-09 23:52:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","University Of Tasmania","","","In Copyright ; http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","","","","COinS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
