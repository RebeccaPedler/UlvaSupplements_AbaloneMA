In Australia, Tasmania's east and south-east coasts are hotspots for PST activity due to recurrent blooms of Alexandrium catenella and Gymnodinium catenatum occurring in differing geographic regions and seasonal patterns. Toxins have been measured above bivalve regulatory levels in filter feeders, predatory crustaceans and herbivorous grazers at maximum levels of 340, 13.6 and 3.0 mg STX.2HCl equiv. kg-1 respectively, affecting commercial and recreational fisheries with a combined annual value of USD 103M. Toxin accumulation and depuration rates are highest in bivalve shellfish, followed by lobster and then abalone. Managing PST risk across these multiple seafood species in an area of recurrent bloom activity is challenging. Currently a siloed approach is taken, with diverse strategies for each species that reflect the harmful algal bloom dynamics and varied fishing activities. This review of Tasmanian data and the following stakeholder consultation identified benefits to adopting an integrated approach to risk management across all seafood species. Benefits included cost efficiencies (USD 54,100 per annum), improved data sharing for real-time awareness, streamlined communication and improved cross-sector collaboration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011542558

The use of abalone interspecific hybrids is gaining attention due to their improved growth and tolerance to environmental challenges. However, hybrids may respond differently to dietary inputs compared to their parental species, which could be optimized to achieve maximum growth potential. Accordingly, we previously reported that the postlarvae of a hybrid cross obtained by mating red and green abalone (H. rufescens [♀] x H. fulgens [♂]) presented higher growth and survival rates than red abalone postlarvae when fed with Macrocystis pyrifera (M) and a mixture of Ulva onhoi and Navicula incerta (UN). Here, to gain a deeper insight into the physiological and metabolic responses of both crosses, we report the results of a transcriptome sequencing analysis to unveil the diet-driven physiological changes within each cross. Our findings indicate that the diet induces modulation in the transcriptional machinery related to macromolecules breakdown, especially, the mixed diet UN induced higher expression of lysosomal enzymes, especially in enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan catabolism, such as arylsulfatases, glucosidases, and alpha-fucosidases, which might indicate a higher ability to break down complex carbohydrates from algae. These transcriptional responses might explain the growth difference between pure and hybrid as well as for abalone fed with M and UN. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000168573

The sea lettuce Ulva australis (UA) and kelp Saccharina japonica by-product (SJBP) have been identified as potential candidates for use as an aquafeed ingredient. In this study, the conventionally used seaweed feed ingredient Undaria pinnatifida was replaced by UA or SJBP at different levels of replacement. Specifically, a diet containing 30% U. pinnatifida meal (control diet, CON) was replaced with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% UA meal or SJBP meal, designated as UA25, UA50, UA75, UA100, SJBP25, SJBP50, SJBP75, and SJBP100, respectively. These diets were fed to the abalone for 6 wk under laboratory conditions. Weight growth rate and specific growth rate were affected by algal source and replacement levels, with values similar in CON, all UA-based diets, and SJBP-diets up to 75% replacement levels (P < 0.05). Likewise, shell morphometry (shell length, shell height, and shell width), and soft-tissue weight mirrored body growth parameters (P < 0.05). Feed efficiency ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and condition index were statistically similar in all dietary treatments, except SJBP100-fed abalone. Generally, moisture content was high in UA-based (except UA25) and CON diets, crude protein in SJBP-based diets (except SJBP25), UA75, UA25, and CON dietary groups (P < 0.05). Crude lipid was similar and statistically higher in SJBP25 and CON than other dietary treatments (P < 0.05). Ash content was high in SJBP-based diets, followed by UA-based diets and CON groups (P < 0.05). Overall, these findings illustrate that up to 100% replacement of U. pinnatifida by UA and 75% of SJBP are feasible in formulated feed without detrimental effect on the growth. Nevertheless, in-depth long-term investigation on the actual commercial nursery complex and grow-out culture is necessary to realize full-scale application in abalone aquaculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105013857438

Therefore, enhancing the heat tolerance of G. lemaneiformis is crucial for prolonging its growth period along with increasing production and economic performance. Proline, a key osmotic regulator, plays an essential role in stress responses, including drought, heat, cold, and high salinity. Here, we investigated the dynamic changes in proline accumulation and its metabolic enzymes response to high-temperature stress in G. lemaneiformis. Results showed that elevated temperatures significantly increased proline accumulation, stimulated the activities of its synthetases pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), while concurrently suppressed the activity of its degrading enzyme proline dehydrogenase (ProDH). Pearson correlation analysis displayed a stronger positive association between proline level and OAT activity than with P5CS or pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) activity, as well as a negative correlation with ProDH activity. Furthermore, exogenous 24-epibrassinolide, trehalose, and ornithine increased OAT activity or its gene transcription, while salicylic acid induced P5CS activity and P5CR2 transcriptional levels, which all resulted in the enhanced proline accumulation. Finally, bioinformatics analysis revealed that GlOAT contains a predicted PLP-binding domain, exhibits a high likelihood of mitochondrial localization, and shows a high degree of phylogenetic conservation. In summary, this study demonstrated that OAT is the critical enzyme involved in proline synthesis under high-temperature stress, which might provide a foundation for future transgenic breeding to improve high-temperature tolerance in G. lemaneiformis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105011827813

As the world’s largest algae and shellfish producer, the carbon sinks potential in China is crucial. Here, the situation of algae and shellfish cultivation in China’s offshore from 2011 to 2020 was elaborated. The intensity of carbon sequestration by algae and shellfish annually was estimated. In 2020, the production of algae and shellfish in China has already reached to 2.62 million tons and 14.8 million tons, with an annual growth rate of 7.03% and 3.14%, respectively. Their annual productivity also maintained an increasing trend, while the rate of productivity increase decreased over ten years except for Porphyra haitanensis, Sinonovacula constricta, and Haliotis discus hannai. Crassostrea gigas and Ruditapes philippinarum were the highest fixed carbon shellfish, and Saccharina japonica was the dominant algae. Meanwhile, the relatively high carbon sink intensity was found in Shandong, Fujian, and Liaoning. In the last decade, the total carbon sink of algae and shellfish was 1.62 million tons and 7.16 million tons, with an increase of 90.55% and 31.73%, respectively. This created an economic value of 3.293 billion dollars. Results indicated that China’s offshore mariculture algae and shellfish assumed the considerable carbon sink capacity. Through rational utilization of the carbon sink resources in algae and shellfish, it provides potential ideas for China to pursue personalized carbon neutrality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010089673

Fucoidan oligosaccharides produced through the enzymatic degradation of fucoidan retain the beneficial properties of polysaccharides while demonstrating improved solubility, bioavailability, and bioactivity. Fucoidanases are essential in studying the structure of fucoidans and producing fucoidan oligosaccharides. However, there is limited research on the structural characterization of fucoidanases that specifically degrade fucoidan, which is essential for fully harnessing the biological activities of the resulting oligosaccharides. In this study, a novel fucoidanase, FcnA, was identified and heterologously expressed. This enzyme could specifically hydrolyze fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus, and exhibited an activity of 399.364 U/mg and demonstrating optimal activity at 50 °C and pH 6.0. The K<inf>m</inf> value of FcnA was 1.0 mg/mL and the V<inf>max</inf> value was 416.67 U/mg. Additionally, FcnA exhibits mesophilic temperature tolerance, retaining over 80 % of its relative activity after incubation for 1 h at temperatures of 50 °C. The results of HPLC and ESI-MS revealed that FcnA could degrade fucoidan into monosaccharides, disaccharides, trisaccharides, and tetrasaccharides. In conclusion, identifying a novel fucoidanase from the GH107 family expands the fucoidanase database and provides new opportunities for the comprehensive utilization of fucoidan. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105009301848

This study evaluated chronic Li toxicity in 30 diverse marine species (22 phyla across five trophic levels) from temperate and tropical locations, using no (significant) effect concentrations (N(S)EC), 10 % effect concentrations (EC10) and median effect concentrations (EC50)) as metrics. Eucaryotic species with calcifying life stages were generally the most sensitive to Li, whereas procaryotic species were the least sensitive. Macrophiothrix caenosa (brittle star) was the most sensitive species, with N(S)EC, EC10 and EC50 values of 0.66 mg/L, 0.99 mg/L and 3.29 mg/L, respectively. The EC10 is only 5–6 times higher than the natural Li baseline concentration in coastal seawater (0.18 mg/L). In contrast, Cyanobium sp. (cyanobacteria) was the least sensitive, with corresponding values of 93.0 mg/L, 121 mg/L and 459 mg/L. Lithium sensitivity differed by as much as 140-fold across the species tested, with no significant difference (p > 0.05) between those from temperate and tropical locations. Free Li ions (Li+), which readily bind to cell receptors, comprised ∼83 % of dissolved Li across the range of N(S)EC, EC10 and EC50 values. A weighted-average species sensitivity distribution was used to establish Li water quality guideline values (WQGVs) to protect marine life (e.g., 1.21 mg/L for 95 % species protection). These new WQGVs will improve Li risk assessment in coastal marine waters, especially as Li emerges as a contaminant of concern. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007056157

The heat-resistant strains G. lemaneiformis are extensively cultivated in the northern and southern coasts of China, yet high temperature in the summertime in southern coasts has hindered the growth and limited the cultivated periods of this seaweed. A vast majority of reports have manifested that exogenous phytohormone brassinosteroids (BRs) can improve the plant heat-tolerance. However, little is known about the effect and its underlying mechanism of BRs in algae. In this study, the effect of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) on the physiological and transcriptional levels was investigated in the high-temperature stressed G. lemaneiformis. Physiological data indicated that EBR application could improve the growth with 1.43-fold on day 5 and non-photochemical quenching parameter, reduce the productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), enhance the accumulations of proline, trehalose, and the levels of endogenous 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine (2MeSiP), 2-methylthio-cis-zeatin riboside (2MeScZR), jasmonic acid (JA), N-[(-)-jasmonoyl]-(l)-phenylalanine (JA-Phe) and salicylic acid 2-O-β-glucoside (SAG) under high-temperature condition. In addition, transcriptomic analysis identified 656 upregulated- and 680 downregulated-genes following the EBR treatment compared to the control group, revealed that EBR activated the metabolic pathways of the glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and synthesis of threonine, methionine, and serine. Taken together, the aforementioned results highlighted the beneficial effect of EBR via alleviating the oxidative stress, promoting the accumulations of osmolytes and stress-related phytohormones, and activating the metabolisms of carbohydrate and amino acid, thereby resulting in the mitigating of growth inhibition by high-temperature stress in G. lemaneiformis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85201625163

To enhance the viability of cultivating H. kamtschatkana for commercial and restoration purposes, more information is needed on the optimal macroalgal diet that maximizes abalone growth and nutrition. This study compares the suitability of two commonly cultivated species of macroalgae as feed: Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), a kelp with relatively low protein content, and Devaleraea mollis (Pacific dulse), a rhodophyte with comparatively high protein content. Fifty H. kamtschatkana specimens, with a mean shell length of 45.25 ± 4.26 mm, were collected from the wild and fed either S. latissima, D. mollis, or an alternating diet of the two for 28 wk. Feed consumption was measured weekly, whereas shell length and weight change were recorded every 2 mo. Despite consuming significantly more S. latissima than D. mollis (P < 0.001, H. kamtschatkana showed no significant difference in specific growth rate (SGR) (P = 0.775) or linear growth rate (LGR) (P = 0.746) among the diets. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was significantly higher for D. mollis than S. latissima (P < 0.001), although there was no significant difference in protein efficiency ratio (PER) (P = 0.129). Proximate composition analyses of abalone tissue showed no significant difference in protein, lipid, carbohydrate, or caloric content across macroalgae diets. Additionally, sexual dimorphism was observed, with females exhibiting significantly higher daily feed consumption (DFC) (P = 0.001), SGR (P = 0.003), and LGR (P = 0.001) than males. These results indicate that whereas both macroalgae species are suitable as feeds for H. kamtschatkana cultivation, the benefits of a D. mollis diet are less pronounced compared with other commercially cultivated abalone species. This study provides actionable insights for those interested in cultivating H. kamtschatkana for commercial or restoration purposes and adds to our understanding of an environmentally and culturally important species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105003146445

Recently, dietary macro-algae supplementation has gained interest as an promoter of health and growth in abalone. In this study, the effects of three graded levels of dietary protein (35, 41 and 47 %) and 15 % dietary supplementation of dried and ground Ulva lactuca on the digestion and excretion processes in juvenile Australian hybrid abalone (Haliotis rubra x H. laevigata) were investigated through analysis of metabolic oxygen consumption (Ṁ<inf>O<inf>2</inf></inf>) and nitrogen excretion (Ṁ<inf>NH<inf>4</inf>+−N</inf>) during meal digestion and assimilation. Trials were conducted at three farm-relevant acclimation temperatures (12, 17 and 22 °C), and abalone acclimated to the highest temperature were additionally subjected to a simulated heatwave. Within the ranges of 35 and 47 % dietary crude protein, no differences were observed in total postprandial energy use, however, significant differences were observed between the three temperatures. Similarly, differences in nitrogen excretion were observed across temperatures but not across dietary protein treatments. Dietary supplementation of U. lactuca led to significantly higher peak and total Ṁ<inf>O<inf>2</inf></inf> throughout the postprandial period at 22 °C. Additionally, total NH<inf>4</inf>+−N excretion was higher at 17 °C when abalone were fed the U. lactuca supplemented diet. No differences in survival were observed between any of the dietary treatments when juvenile abalone underwent the simulated heatwave, however, the 15 % U. lactuca treatment did exhibit consistently higher Ṁ<inf>O<inf>2</inf></inf>.

Species introductions and climate-driven range shifts alter the quantity and quality of these subsidies in donor habitats, thereby potentially influencing recipient communities. Such impacts might be particularly important when detrital shifts alter detritivore feeding and performance. Attempts to identify a general theory predicting the consequences of invasive species on detritivores have been challenging, in part because most theories have been based on the study of microbes or consumers of living prey. Further, two recent meta-analyses disagree about the impacts of invasive plants on detritivore populations. Here, we examined the potential impact of a human-mediated shift in macroalgal detrital subsidy from native giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) to invasive devilweed (Sargassum horneri) on recipient rocky shores, with an emphasis on exploring species-specific impacts. We assessed consumer performance on single species diets or on a mixture in no-choice assays, and we assessed feeding preference in choice assays. Additionally, we examined the impacts of this shift on grazing of native benthic seaweeds by an intertidal consumer assemblage. Replacing native Macrocystis with invasive Sargassum had consumer-specific impacts on performance—suppressing growth of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) but enhancing growth of black turban snails (Tegula funebralis). The effect of mixed diets on consumer growth also displayed consumer specificity. Also, replacing Macrocystis with invasive Sargassum increased grazing of native benthic seaweeds by a realistic detritivore assemblage, but only on the habitat-forming brown seaweed, Silvetia compressa. Thus, invasion-mediated changes in detrital wrack composition had consumer- and seaweed-specific impacts. Such species specificity could underlie disagreements about the impact of species invasions on detritivore populations and could impede our ability to identify a general theory about how species invasions will impact recipient communities via detrital pathways. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218957349

This study evaluated the reproductive performance of tropical abalone (Haliotis squamata) broodstock, induced by feeding them formulated feed containing macroalgae as one of its protein sources. The experimental broodstock specimens were fed a formulated diet consisting of a combination of three macroalgae species: Gracillaria sp., Ulva sp., and Sargassum sp., with increasing protein levels (30, 35, 40, and 45%). The broodstocks were reared in a flow-through water system and fed the respective diet twice a day (5 AM and 8 PM). The gonad maturity level, gonad somatic index, fecundity, and hatching rate were measured at the end of the experiment. This study indicates that the gonad somatic index, fecundity, and hatching rate of the eggs were significantly influenced by the protein level of the diet, with higher values being obtained from the broodstock fed with high protein diets (40-45% crude protein). However, the gonad maturity level showed no difference across all treatments.

Interestingly, Vibrio alginolyticus, which once reported to be a probiotic or pathogen for multiple marine organisms, was strongly proved to be the pathogen causing “Baotou” disease in this study. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene profiling revealed that V. alginolyticus was the most abundant and dominant bacterium on the algal thalli suffering from “Baotou” disease, whereas its presence was scarcely detected on healthy thalli. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that a large number of V. alginolyticus cells were found to be attached to the algal thalli with “Baotou” disease and the rotten thalli acquired by the lab infection treatment. V. alginolyticus could cause the rotten symptoms which were consistent with those of “Baotou” disease.

Results showed that Sahlingia subintegra induced significantly higher settlement rates (58.17 ± 12.71%) compared to CCA, Ulvella leptochaete and Rhodosorus marinus. In all treatments, post-larvae were weekly fed a mix of diatoms (Amphora sp., and Navicula incerta).

For example, the loss of the native main food, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the subsequent takeover of non-indigenous algae species represent a major threat to abalone growth and survival. In Baja California, Mexico two introduced macroalgae, Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum horneri have become common in the past decade with unknown consequences on native herbivores. In this work, we explored the effect of these invasive algae on the growth and survival of juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. One hundred and ten juvenile red abalone were tagged and fed with invasive algae U. pinnatifida and S. horneri, and a control with M. pyrifera. Then, the shell length, body weight, and survivorship were assessed monthly for 90 days. Results show that abalone fed U. pinnatifida had a total growth in length, weight, and survivorship, similar to those fed native M. pyrifera. In contrast, abalone fed S. horneri had significantly lower overall performance. Marine heatwaves and other climatic impacts are expected to favour the establishment of invasive species.

The present study aimed to investigate how the growth and reproductive performances of female broodstock Haliotis discus hannai were affected by the dietary supplementation of five lipids: fish oil (FO), perilla seed oil (PO), safflower oil (SO), olive oil (OO), and lard (LO). A total of 500 adult female abalones were randomly divided into five groups (four replicates per group) and fed with five lipid-supplemented diets for 90 days. The LO group was the worst (p < 0.05), while the FO group significantly showed the best growth performance, gonad index (GI), fertility, fertilization rate, larvae hatching rate, and larval attachment rate (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, histological and fatty acid analysis revealed that the FO group contained high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which may contribute to ovarian maturation and egg quality. Therefore, the best lipids for improving the growth and reproductive performances of female abalone might be FO enriched in highly unsaturated fatty acids rather than plant-derived lipids, providing new insights into nutritional research and applications in vegetarian mollusks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010887535

This study aimed to assess the effect of culture methods and tank cleaning frequency on abalone growth, water quality, and sludge characteristics. The study was conducted for 16 weeks. Four treatments were used, namely, abalone cocultured with sea cucumber cleaned once (AS1) and twice weekly (AS2); abalone monoculture cleaned once (A1) and cleaned twice weekly (A2). Abalone (initial avg weight = 40.9 g) were maintained under commercial stocking conditions in flow through systems at a salinity of 35 ppt and fed a commercial formulated diet (Abfeed™) and fresh seaweed (Ulva lacinulata and Gracillaria gracilis). The stocking densities were 200 abalone m−2 and 50 sea cucumbers m−2. The sea cucumbers (initial average weight = 12.5 g) fed on the abalone faeces and leftover feed, which settled at the abalone tank's bottom (sludge). There was a significant interaction between the type of culture and the frequency of cleaning on abalone weight (F <inf>(1,476)</inf> = 12.41, p < 0.001). Abalone in the A2 treatment group showed higher growth (p = 0.006) than those of the A1 treatment group, while abalone in AS1 had significantly higher growth (p < 0.001) than those in the AS2 treatment group. Also, abalone in AS1 showed higher growth (p = 0.026) than abalone in the A1 treatment. However, abalone in AS1 had growth similar (p = 0.53) to those in A2. The survival rate of the sea cucumbers was high, however, the sea cucumbers experienced a reduction in weight regardless of the treatment. This study showed that growth optimisation in abalone farming can be achieved by cleaning tanks twice instead of once weekly. However, when abalone are cocultured with sea cucumber, tanks need only be cleaned once a week without compromising abalone growth or water quality. The coculture of abalone and sea cucumber results in an additional aquacultured product, a significant reduction in labour and other associated costs of cleaning, without an additional cost of production. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191946130

The Ulva serves as a biofilter and the co-produced Ulva is often used as feed for the abalone. To better understand the potential benefits and risks associated with this practice, this study characterised the bacterial microbiome associated with the seawater and Ulva raceways receiving abalone effluent (IMTA system) and compared this to Ulva tanks supplied with fertilised seawater (non-IMTA; control). Ulva samples were collected from each Ulva system, and water samples were collected at the inlet and outlet of each system. Bacterial communities were assessed using a culture-based approach and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 16S rDNA region. It was observed that Ulva has the potential to reduce the bacterial load of abalone effluent, with the total number of potential culturable Vibrio species declining from 150×103 cells mL-1 in the inlet to 37×103 cells mL-1 in the outlet of the Ulva system. The NGS dataset supported these findings, with a reduction observed in Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas from the inlet to outlet samples. A lower number of genera (p < 0.05) were observed on Ulva when compared with water samples, indicating that Ulva has a beneficial, modulatory effect on bacteria. These findings contribute towards the growing body of evidence for the benefits of seaweeds in IMTA and addresses the biosecurity concerns of abalone farmers wishing to improve the circularity of their farming activities by incorporating seaweeds. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85198921932

There are seven recognized species in the genus, including the endemic and vulnerable E. galapagensis. Despite some remarkable morphological variations, Eisenia species are characterized by two twisted stipe-like parts arising from the main stipe. Genetic data have recently contributed to the understanding of Eisenia systematics; however, additional studies on E. desmarestioides, E. cokeri, and E. gracilis are needed. Aside from economic benefits, Eisenia farming has various other essential benefits, such as resource sustainability and ecosystem benefits, which are especially important in climate change scenarios. Spore-based cultivation has been reported only for E. arborea, E. bicyclis, and E. nipponica (formerly known as E. arborea sensu Arasaki). This kelp is widely consumed in Korea and Japan and utilized as a raw material for alginate production and feed for abalone cultures. Because of its nutritional composition and mineral concentration, Eisenia is also a potential food source outside Asia. Moreover, various pharmacological applications of Eisenia have been reported, particularly those related to antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Phlorotannins (brown algal polyphenols) derived from E. bicyclis are linked to these bioactivities.

To date, over 95% of the abalone supply has been contributed by farming. Macroalgae are the natural food of abalones. However, the supply of macroalgae is unstable owing to seasonal restrictions. This limits the success of abalone farming. Therefore, formulated diets are crucial for the ongoing expansion and sustainable development of abalone culture. The most important considerations in formulated diets are the nutrient composition and commercially available feed ingredients. This review presents a comprehensive description of the nutrient requirements of abalones and the role that nutrients play in regulating abalone growth and health. The dietary proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, macroalgae sources and feed additives currently used in abalone feeds were subsequently summarised. Additionally, this review also highlights the importance of prioritizing the development of sustainable alternative sources of proteins, carbohydrates and macroalgae to meet the increasing demand for abalone feed.

This question is becoming more pressing as trophic interactions shift with rapid climate change. Sea urchins and abalone are key invertebrates in the habitats where they reside. Sea urchins are critical members of exemplar trophic cascades in kelp forests due to their impact on kelp establishment and maintenance; yet their populations are controlled by predators, such as sea otters and sunflower sea stars. Abalone compete with urchins for macroalgal food resources and therefore can help regulate urchin populations in kelp forests. Given that both urchin tests and abalone shells used for predator defense are com¬prised of calcium carbonate, much research has been conducted on the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on these calcified structures. A growing body of literature has shown that urchin tests are less calcified and break with less force under OA condi¬tions. Less is known about abalone, but their shells also appear to respond negatively to OA. Using kelp forest communities as exemplar ecosystems, we discuss the morphological, biomechanical, and physiological responses to OA in urchins and abalone and consider how these individual level responses scale to trophic interactions and ultimately whole ecosystem processes. Al-ell studied, calcified mechanisms for food hus, examining both the feeding and de-though the impacts of OA on the calcified structures used for defense have been w consumption, such as the Aristotle's lantern of urchins, are much less understood, fense sides of trophic interactions would greatly improve our understanding of OA responses across individual to ecosystem scales. More generally, measurements of morphological, biomechanical, and physiological responses to OA can be made in individuals to help predict higher level ecological responses, which would greatly contribute to broader predictions of whole ecosystem responses to OA. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85203175602

These features make E. cava a good candidate for cellular biotechnology research, which is often dependent on protoplasts. To date, however, there have been no studies that have focused on the isolation of protoplast from E. cava. In this study, we sought to optimize the yield of protoplasts from cultured young sporophytes of E. cava using commercial enzymes, with a particular focus on identifying the key conditions for achieving high protoplast yield, including enzyme concentration, chelation pre-treatment, growth, temperature, incubation time, pH, and osmolarity. Protoplast production conditions were modeled using response surface methodology (RSM) via Box–Behnken design (BBD), and the practical utility of these conditions was experimentally verified. We found that an enzyme composition of 1.67 % cellulase RS and 4 U mL−1 alginate lyase without chelation pre-treatment, at 1570 mOsm L−1 H<inf>2</inf>O and pH 6 produced the highest protoplast yield of 4.45 ± 2.16 × 107 protoplasts g−1 fresh weight when incubated at 20 °C for 4 h using young (2-week-old) cultures. Our data revealed a strong positive correlation between growth rate and protoplast yield, thereby indicating that growth rate could serve as an index for determining the optimal timing of protoplast isolation from cultured material. The optimized protocol resulted in protoplasts capable of cell wall formation, division, and regeneration. These findings indicate the efficacy of commercial enzymes in protoplast isolation and that BBD-mediated RSM is a useful approach for the production of viable protoplasts from kelp sporophytes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192450911

A potential archive of eastern Pacific Coast environmental variability is the intertidal mussel species Mytilus californianus. Archaeologists have collected copious stable isotopic (δ18O and δ13C) data from M. californianus shells to study human history at California’s Channel Islands. When analyzed together, these isotopic data provide windows into 9000 years of Holocene isotopic variability and M. californianus life history. Here we synthesize over 6000 δ18O and δ13C data points from 13 published studies to investigate M. californianus shell isotopic variability across ontogenetic, geographic, seasonal, and millennial scales. Our analyses show that M. californianus may grow and record environmental information more irregularly than expected due to the competing influences of calcification, ontogeny, metabolism, and habitat. Stable isotope profiles with five or more subsamples per shell recorded environmental information ranging from seasonal to millennial scales, depending on the number of shells analyzed and the resolution of isotopic subsampling. Individual shell profiles contained seasonal cycles and an accurate inferred annual temperature range of ~ 5∘C, although ontogenetic growth reduction obscured seasonal signals as organisms aged. Collectively, the mussel shell record reflected millennial-scale climate variability and an overall 0.5‰ depletion in δ18O<inf>shell</inf> from 8800 BP to the present. The archive also revealed local-scale oceanographic variability in the form of a warmer coastal mainland δ18O<inf>shell</inf> signal (-0.32‰ ) compared to a cooler offshore islands δ18O<inf>shell</inf> signal (0.33‰ ). While M. californianus is a promising coastal archive, we emphasize the need for high-resolution subsampling from multiple individuals to disentangle impacts of calcification, metabolism, ontogeny, and habitat and more accurately infer environmental and biological patterns recorded by an intertidal species. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194025618

Its hepatopancreas is rich in cellulases and other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, which provide it the remarkable ability to digest cellulose-rich macroalgae; nevertheless, its cellulolytic systems are poorly explored. This manuscript describes some functional and structural properties of an endogenous trimeric glycosylated endoglucanase from H. rufescens. The purified enzyme showed a molecular mass of 23.4 kDa determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which behaved as a homotrimer in gel filtration chromatography and zymograms. According to the periodic acid-Schiff reagent staining, detecting sugar moieties in SDS-PAGE gel confirmed that abalone cellulase is a glycoprotein. Hydrolysis of cello-oligosaccharides and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranosides confirmed its endo/ exoactivity. A maximum enzyme activity toward 0.5% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose of 53.9 ± 1.0 U/mg was achieved at 45°C and pH 6.0. We elucidated the abalone cellulase primary structure using proteases and mass spectrometry methods. Based on these results and using a bioinformatic approach, we identified the gene encoding this enzyme and deduced its full-length amino acid sequence; the mature protein comprised 177 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 19.1 kDa and, according to sequence similarity, it was classified into the glycosyl-hydrolase family 45 subfamily B. An AlphaFold theoretical model and docking simulations with cellopentaose confirmed that abalone cellulase is a β-sheet rich protein, as also observed by circular dichroism experiments, with conserved catalytic residues: Asp26, Asn109, and Asp134. Interestingly, the AlphaFold-Multimer analysis indicated a trimeric assembly for abalone cellulase, which supported our experimental findings.

Abalone are marine gastropods that can display a high level of phenotypic variation, including slow-growing or ‘stunted’ variants. This investigation focused on identifying factors that are associated with growth performance, with particular interest in the slow-growing variants. Tissue alterations in H. iris were examined using histopathological techniques, in relation to growth performance, contrasting populations classified by commercial harvesters as ‘stunted’ (i.e., slow-growing) and ‘non-stunted’ (i.e., fast-growing) from four sites around the Chatham Islands (New Zealand). Ten adults and 10 sub-adults were collected from each of the four sites and prepared for histological assessment of condition, tissue alterations, presence of food and presence of parasites. The gut epithelium connective tissue, digestive gland, gill lamellae and right kidney tissues all displayed signs of structural differences between the slow-growing and fast-growing populations. Overall, several factors appear to be correlated to growth performance. The individuals from slow-growing populations were observed to have more degraded macroalgal fragments in the midgut, increased numbers of ceroid granules in multiple tissues, as well as increased prevalence of birefringent mineral crystals and haplosporidian-like parasites in the right kidney. The histopathological approaches presented here complement anecdotal field observations of reduced seaweed availability and increased sand incursion at slow-growing sites, while providing an insight into the health of individual abalone and sub-populations.

Based on land use data, socialeconomic statistics and pollution source investigation data, the pollutant discharge coefficient method was used to evaluate the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes into Sansha Bay, the largest bay in Fujian Province. A comprehensive and systematic analysis was conducted to investigate the composition and distribution of the pollutants. The results show that the net total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes produced by land-based sources (including industrial production, residents' living, cultivation, livestock and poultry breeding, and land-based fish farming) and sea-based pollution sources (including tidal flat aquaculture, raft culture, and cage culture) in 2020 were 238 and 622 tons, respectively. The primary source of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus was land-based pollution, with fluxes of 2 564 and 352 tons, respectively. The fluxes of total nitrogen and total phosphorus from the primary sea-based pollution sources were -2 326 and 270 tons, respectively. Cultivation was the dominant land-based source of pollution, accounting for 46.4% and 41.4% of the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes, respectively. Notable heterogeneity was observed in the total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes across the watersheds. The Jiaoxi Watershed, with the largest watershed area, was responsible for the greatest proportion of land-based pollutant fluxes. Feed-based aquaculture (such as fish, abalone, and sea cucumber feeding) was the main sea-based pollution source, whereas the non-feeding shellfish and macroalgae can assist in the assimilation of the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211595779

The halophyte sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum) is nutritionally valuable and shows potential as a novel bait source for abalone. We analyzed the nutrient composition of blanched and salted sea purslane to assess the value of sea purslane as abalone feed. Subsequently, blanched and salted sea purslane were separately used as the sole feed for Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) with the same specifications in each group (shell length: 5.161±0.315 cm, body weight: 16.90±3.07 g). The red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis served as the control feed. The abalone were feed once every 4 days over an 80-day culture cycle, with sufficient feed dispensed each time to ensure the provision of adequate feed and the generation of leftovers. There were four main findings. First, moisture, energy, crude protein (dry basis), crude fat, carbohydrate, and ash contents were (89.08± 0.01)%, (103.44±0.15) kJ/100 g, (12.49±0.28)%, (2.93±0.06)%, (20.34±0.28)%, and (29.10±0.08)%, respectively, for blanched sea purslane and (59.37±0.04)%, (139.38±0.79) kJ/100 g, (4.16±0.08)%, (1.25±0.01)%, (5.74±0.18)%, and (72.80±0.05)%, respectively, for salted sea purslane. Both types of sea purslane feed contained 18 amino acids, indicating a comprehensive amino acid profile that was relatively close to that of Pacific abalone muscle in terms of the presence of 11 important amino acids. Second, the two types of sea purslane feed significantly influenced the feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of Pacific abalone (P<0.05). The FI and FCR were highest in abalone that fed on salted sea purslane and lowest in abalone that fed on G. lemaneiformis. Neither type of sea purslane feed significantly influenced the survival rate, average daily shell length gain, average daily body weight gain, specific growth rate of shell length, specific growth rate of body weight, condition factor, or meat yield of Pacific abalone (P>0.05). Third, both types of sea purslane feed significantly increased the ash content and reduced the moisture, collagen, and total amino acid contents of Pacific abalone muscle (P<0.05); however, they did not significantly influence the crude fat content, essential amino acids/total amino acids ratio, first limiting amino acid content(P>0.05). The sea purslane feed could increase the linoleic acid and α-linolenic contents of Pacific abalone muscle. Fourth, there were no significant differences in the influence of the two types of sea purslane feed on the springiness and resilience of Pacific abalone muscle tissue (P>0.05). However, blanched sea purslane significantly reduced the hardness and chewiness of the muscle tissue (P<0.05), while salted sea purslane significantly increased the hardness of the muscle tissue (P<0.05). In conclusion, both types of sea purslane feed can replace G. lemaneiformis as feed for Pacific abalone within an 80-day culture cycle. Pacific abalone fed with sea purslane had good production performance and nutritional value, with salted purslane contributing to improved abalone muscle texture. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85211355943

As a signaling molecule, non-reducing disaccharide trehalose plays an important role in enduring high temperature, drought and other adverse stresses. To explore the role and mechanism of trehalose in the stress resistance of G. lemaneiformis, this paper investigated the effects of exogenous trehalose on the growth, stress resistance-related substances, metabolic enzymes, endogenous salicylic acid and related genes under high temperature stress using physiological and biochemical test, HPLC-MS/MS and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that application of 10 mmol/L trehalose promoted the algal growth and proline content of G. lemaneiformis with 0.34-fold (3 d) and 0.30-fold increases (24 h) compared to the control, respectively. Meanwhile, trehalose significantly activated the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and the activities of superoxide dismutase and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, but malonaldehyde content and lipoxidase (LOX) activity were reduced. Moreover, trehalose significantly stimulated the activity and gene expression of isochorismate synthase, the key enzyme in salicylic acid biosynthesis, and the accumulation of salicylic acid (2.05-fold). Finally, supplementation with trehalose could maintain the stable increase of the gene expression level of heat shock protein 70, while the lox2 gene expression was downregulated at 12 h. All of these results revealed that trehalose could promote algal growth through scavenging the reactive oxygen species, alleviating the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, enhancing the accumulation of osmolytes and phytohormones and so on. This study verifies that exogenous trehalose plays a vital role in resisting high temperature, which will provide a reference for future breeding efforts to improve the stress resistance of G. lemaneiformis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85198381388

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the differences between the wild-type and cultivated G. lemaneiformis. Here, 648 up-regulated and 837 down-regulated proteins were screened using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, and these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were concentrated in the pathways including ""Ribosome"", ""Photosynthesis-antenna proteins"", ""alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism"", and ""Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis"". The most prominent pathway was ""Ribosome"", namely, 116 out of 119 ribosome-associated proteins were up-regulated in G. lemaneiformis 981 compared to the wild type. Subsequently, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) validated the credibility of the iTRAQ results. Finally, ""Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis""and ""Photosynthesis-antenna proteins""pathways were also found to be significantly changed in G. lemaneiformis 981 validated by gene expression profiling analysis.

Two feeds were formulated: one without polyphenol reduction (EA01) and one with polyphenol reduction (EA02). Rehydrated E. arborea (ER03) was used as the control feed. The polyphenol content was quantified in EA01 and EA02, and the stability and hardness of all three feeds were measured at 24 h after immersion. Feed preference was evaluated through attraction and consumption tests on day 1, 6, and 12. The polyphenol concentration was reduced by 41% in EA02 (13.9 mg GAE g−1) compared to that of EA01 (33.3 mg GAE g−1). Both formulated feeds showed 88% stability and hardness values > 680 g cm−2, which were greater than those of the control (ER03, 66% and 285 g cm−2, respectively). Abalone were more attracted to EA02 and ER03 on day 1, 6, and 12 than to EA01 on the same days. A similar trend was observed with consumption. EA02 and ER03 were the most consumed feeds (> 6 g day−1) throughout the experiment, and no significant differences in consumption were observed between these feeds. On the other hand, juvenile H. fulgens showed a greater attraction to and consumption of EA02 (reduced polyphenol content) than EA01 (no reduction in polyphenol content). This allows us to conclude that EA02 can replace rehydrated algae as a suitable feed source for juvenile H. fulgens. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163572728

However, a limited occurrence of the orange-footed muscle trait makes it a valuable candidate for breeding programs. In our research, we examined the inheritance pattern of the orange-footed trait and conducted a 90-day feeding trial for H. gigantea to compare the influence of formulated feed and macroalgae on pigment enrichment and growth rates. Our results suggest that the orange-footed trait has a recessive nature relative to its common counterpart and demonstrates stable inheritance. We also identified a significant correlation between color-difference values (a*) and total carotenoid content (TCC) (R2 = 0.955, p < 0.05), suggesting the TCC in abalone foot muscle can be estimated using the a* value. Furthermore, introducing carotenoids to formulated feed imparts an orange hue to the foot muscle, but this effect is inferior compared to using Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis with a similar carotenoid content. This suggests that H. gigantea has a higher absorption efficiency for the carotenoids from the macroalgae G. lemaneiformis compared to formulated feed. Growth assessments indicate that the formulated feed, enriched with higher crude protein than G. lemaneiformis, optimally supports H. gigantea growth.

Production of ethanol by such means has so far been unsuccessful using marine microbial biocatalysts. To produce ethanol from alginate, an alternative pathway consisting of a pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc) and an alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (adhII) derived from Zymomonas mobilis strain ZM4 was implemented into a metabolically engineered bacterium, Vibrio halioticoli, which is a representative marine alginate decomposer. No ethanol from alginate was produced in the wild-type V. halioticoli; however, the engineered V. halioticoli harboring the pdc and adhII operon (Pet operon), designated to the V. halioticoli (Pet), was able to produce 880 mg/L ethanol in maximum from 1.5% alginate for 72 h.

During this period, abalone pass through profound morphological and physiological changes, which suitable nutrient requirements must sustain. An inadequate diet can result in adverse effects such as late metamorphosis, starvation, slow growth and even death during this phase. Two strategies have been proposed to increase the growth and survival rates of weaning abalone: (i) extending feeding with benthic diatoms and (ii) abalone hybridization via interspecific crosses. To evaluate the efficiency of the two strategies, we assessed the growth and survival rates of postlarvae of pure red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and a hybrid obtained by crossing red abalone females with green abalone (H. fulgens) males. Both crosses were supplied with six different diets consisting of either one macroalgae mono-diet (Macrocystis pyrifera or Ulva ohnoi) or a mixture with Navicula incerta. Overall, cross-specific diets achieved better growth rates, suggesting that each cross may need specific food items (nutrients) during weaning. Moreover, pure red abalone generally showed the highest growth rates, while the hybrid abalone showed the highest survival rates with most tested diets. Hence, hybrids appear to be better at withstanding stressful con-ditions, and their use in aquaculture could reduce losses and increase commercial production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153335415

In the current study, an in-depth investigation of the food value of Sargassum horneri as a replacement for Undaria pinnatifida on growth, body composition, body histology, gut microbiota, and the taste sensory profile of abalone Haliotis discus hannai was carried out. After a 12-week feeding trial, the results indicated that 25% replacement (SH25) induced the highest shell-growth performance and best feed utilization values, although there was no significant difference in weight-related growth parameters with the basal (no inclusion of S. horneri) and 50% replacement (SH50) diets. Interestingly, the highest protein content was detected in abalone fed the basal diet followed by SH25 and SH50. The high replacement of S. horneri in the diet showed signs of structural integrity loss in the digestive gland. The results from the pyrosequencing of the genomic DNA from the gut of the abalone indicated an insignificant difference in α-diversity parameters and only a clear boundary was observed between SH0 and SH100 diets based on principal coordinate analysis. The bacterial genera Psychrilobacter, Vibrio, and Mycoplasma predominantly occupied the gut of the abalone, although there is a difference in their relative abundance. The taste screening experiment through the use of an electronic tongue showed a comparable taste profile of the abalone and is independent of the diets given. The findings of the present study showed that S. horneri, up to 50% replacement of macroalgal ingredients, can be utilized in feed formulation for H. discus hannai. These, in turn, contribute to the expanding knowledge on the utilization of biofouling and non-traditional macroalgae for sustainable abalone aquaculture practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148363258

To determine the longitudinal growth characteristics of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), shell colour rings were manipulated by feeding alternative algae, and shell length (SL) identification was performed at different ages. Eight SL records were obtained from 3147 individuals in 192 full-sib families at 6, 7, 9, 13, 18, 24, 28, and 32 months after hatching. To estimate the additive genetic and environmental variance components, longitudinal genetic analysis of repeated SL measurements was conducted using multivariate, auto-regressive, antedependence and random regression models with restricted maximum likelihood method. The results showed that the multivariate model with common full-sib family variance and residual heterogeneity of variance was the best model for the given dataset. Heritability estimates showed a decreasing trend with age, which is similar to the results obtained from the quadratic polynomial random regression model, and ranged from 0.629 at 9 months to 0.259 at 32 months. The separate rearing and tagging of single abalone at 6 months may have led to significant common environment family bias and overestimation of heritability. The antedependence model did not achieve a better fit for the obtained dataset. Estimates of genetic correlation between contiguous ages were high, ranging from 0.622 between 6 and 32 months to 0.987 between 28 and 32 months. The results demonstrated that genetic gain can be obtained in selection for Pacific abalone growth and outlined information regarding the age at which selection should be performed.

A comparatively small number of nations, mostly those in East and Southeast Asia, practice seaweed farming. Between 2000 and 2018, the global output of marine macroalgae, sometimes known as seaweed, increased by more than thrice, from 10.6 million tonnes to 32.4 million tonnes. The trade of seaweeds in 2018 was of USD 2 billion. Seaweeds dominate aquacultured aquatic algae, which have shown very slow growth in recent years. Some of the 32.4 million tonnes of farmed seaweed produced in 2018 (such as Undaria pinnatifida, Porphyra spp., and Caulerpa spp., produced in East and Southeast Asia) are produced primarily for human consumption, though low-quality products and factory scraps are used for other things, such as abalone culture feed. In fact, seaweed production decreased by 0.7% in 2018. This shift was mostly brought on by Southeast Asia's decreased production and the slow growth of tropical seaweed species, while the production of temperate and coldwater species from seaweed farming was still increasing. The major factor behind the rise in farmed seaweed production over the past 10years, despite a recent slowdown in growth rates, has been the rapid expansion of the farming of tropical seaweed species in Indonesia (Kappaphycus alvarezii and Eucheuma spp.) as a source of raw materials for the extraction of carrageenan. From less than four million tonnes in 2010 to over 11 million tonnes in 2015 and 2016, with comparable production levels in 2017 and 2018, Indonesia boosted its seaweed farming output. Due to secrecy, only a few producing nations in Europe and North America have reported much information on small-scale seaweed growing.

Macroalgae are also used to feed farmed abalone in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa, and Chile. Abalone cultured in intensive systems are predominantly reliant on formulated feeds. These diets are formulated using current knowledge of the nutritional requirements of a range of cultured abalone and fish species, and use a range of terrestrial ingredients (cereal, oilseed, and pulse meals) and low levels of marine ingredients (sustainable levels of fish meal and fish oil). Any number of ingredient and inclusion level combinations can be used to arrive at the nutrient specifications. Abalone, like fish and other animals, have a requirement for protein (essential amino acids), lipids (omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids), and a range of vitamins and minerals. Although research into abalone dietary development has been extensive, knowledge gaps remain regarding nutrient requirements and their role in growth, health, and product quality. Unlike for some commonly cultured freshwater and marine fish, such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), knowledge of the key nutrient requirements for essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals for commonly cultured species of abalone are incomplete or nonexistent. This places some constraints on formulating commercial production diets for optimum growth and health. To improve abalone production further, it is recommended that research be conducted to establish more detailed nutrient requirement information for abalone on a species-by-species basis. Research needs to occur in relation to age, water temperature, and the use of traditional and new ingredients for formulated feeds to optimize commercial abalone production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166920412

To explore the feasibility of using the brown alga, Sargassum horneri, as a potential substitute for abalone feed, it is important to identify the feed preference and attractant effect of S. horneri on Pacific abalone. Our experiments indicated that the feeding-associated movement of abalone could be detected using a video track-ing system under indirect illumination with dim red light. To further analyze the attraction potentials of various test materials, preference analysis was performed using Avicel-coated glass plates with ground powders of various seaweeds (e.g., S. horneri, Saccharina japonica, and Undaria pinnatifida) and commercial abalone feed, together with coffee waste. Heat map analysis indicated greater attraction by the kelp S. japonica than by S. horneri and commercial feed, which showed similar preference levels. Feeding preference based on the area of Avicel eaten by abalone showed a significant preference for U. pinnatifida over S. horneri (feeding area: 68.6 ± 20.1% vs. 37.5 ± 22.4%, p < 0.05). Additionally, the feeding area was significantly greater for plates with S. ja-ponica than for plates with S. horneri (44.0 ± 16.6% vs. 22.6 ± 15.4%, p < 0.05).

The results showed a significant increase in feeding preference upon addition of S. horneri up to 50% and 75%, suggesting its potential for use as an appetite-enhancing feed additive.

Colder seawater temperature in the winter/spring (February and March), which is regulated by the extension of the cold Oyashio Current, plays an important role in establishing the kelp forest through reducing the grazing of herbivores during the critical period of kelp germination and early growth.

To further understand the response mechanism of G. lemaneiformis to blue light, the omics analysis was used, which revealed that blue light redirected metabolic pathways toward the synthesis of diverse primary and secondary metabolic products, divided into four categories, including photosynthesis, antioxidant system, energy metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis. Among them, the genes encoding photosynthetic pigments and phycobiliproteins increased significantly, but the carbon fixation pathway, the ASA-GSH cycle, and TCA cycle were down-regulated, and more carbon flowed into the synthesis pathway of agar and polysaccharides, which were consistent with the changes of physiological parameters. These findings helped us to understand the mechanism of G. lemaneiformis responding to blue light and provide a new perspective for the culture of high-agar content G. lemaneiformis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132229916

The brown algae, Undaria pinnatifida and Saccharina japonica are major aquaculture species and have been principally utilized for human food and abalone feed in Korea. This review discusses the diversity, population structure and genomics of kelps. In addition, we have introduced new cultivar development efforts considering climate change, and potential carbon sequestration of kelp aquaculture in Korea. U. pinnatifida showed high diversity within the natural populations but reduced genetic diversity in cultivars. However, very few studies of S. japonica have been conducted in terms of population structure. Since studies on cultivar development began in early 2000s, five U. pinnatifida and one S. japonica varieties have been registered to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). To meet the demands for seaweed biomass in various industries, more cultivars should be developed with specific traits to meet application demands. Additionally, cultivation technologies should be diversified, such as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) and offshore aquaculture, to achieve environmental and economic sustainability. These kelps are anticipated to be important sources of blue carbon in Korea. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141152314

The efficient utilization of alginate depends on alginate lyases to catalyze the degradation, and remains to be further explored. In this study, 354 strains were isolated from the gut of adult abalones, which mainly feed on brown algae. Among them, 100 alginate-degrading strains were gained and the majority belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria, followed by the Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria. A marine bacterium, Agarivorans sp. B2Z047, had the strongest degradation ability of alginate with the largest degradation circle and the highest enzyme activity. The optimal alginate lyase production medium of strain B2Z047 was determined as 1.1% sodium alginate, 0.3% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, and 0.1% MgSO<inf>4</inf> in artificial seawater (pH 7.0). Cells of strain B2Z047 were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, motile by flagella, short rod-shaped, and approximately 0.7–0.9 µm width and 1.2–1.9 µm length. The optimal growth conditions were determined to be at 30◦C, pH 7.0–8.0, and in 3% (w/v) NaCl. A total of 12 potential alginate lyase genes were identified through whole genome sequencing and prediction, which belonged to polysaccharide lyase family 6, 7, 17, and 38 (PL6, PL7, PL17, and PL38, respectively). Furthermore, the degradation products of nine alginate lyases were detected, among which Aly38A was the first alginate lyase belonging to the PL38 family that has been found to degrade alginate. The combination of alginate lyases functioning in the alginate-degrading process was further demonstrated by the growth curve and alginate lyase production of strain B2Z047 cultivated with or without sodium alginate, as well as the content changes of total sugar and reducing sugar and the transcript levels of alginate lyase genes.

Tunic meal of sea squirt (TSS) is one of the marine fishery by-products that contains a variety of nutrients. In this study, we evaluated TSS as a substitute for FM and MA in abalone (Haliotis discus) diet. A total of 27,600 abalones was distributed into 36 net cages (2300 abalones in 3 cages/diet). Two-way [substitution source (FM and MA), and substitution ratio (50% and 100%)] ANOVA with the repeated design was used. Extruded pellets (EPs) were made up of the control diet (Con), which contained 14% FM, and 25% MA. Fifty, and 100% of both FM and MA were substituted with an equal amount of TSS, referred to as the FM50, FM100, MA50, and MA100 diets, respectively. Undaria pinnatifida was prepared to compare the effect of EPs on abalone. All experimental diets were fed to duplicate groups of abalone for 33 weeks. After the 16-week feeding trial, abalone were subjected to air, high temperature, and low salinity exposures for 24-h, and then monitored for survival. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed with the MA50 and MA100 diets were greater than those of abalone fed with all other diets, except for SGR of abalone fed with the Con diet. Chemical composition of the soft body of abalone was reflected from the dietary nutrient composition. Abalone fed the MA50 diet achieved the highest survival after the 24-h air and high-temperature exposures.

Previous studies have found that orange-muscle abalones are rich in carotenoids, but the effects of different diets on the accumulation of carotenoids are unknown. In this study, the effects of macroalgae (Gracilaria lemaneiformis), fresh and dried kelp (Laminaria japonica) on the contents of the predominant carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, β-carotene, and fucoxanthin, between the common and orange-muscle mutant of Haliotis gigantea were compared through a one-year culture experiment. Our study confirmed that carotenoids in abalones mainly come from diets, and the carotenoid types in the muscles were similar to their diets. We also found that feeding on G.lemaneiformis played an important role in maintaining a stable carotenoid content over time, especially zeaxanthin in H.gigantea. Our data also provided that abalones had a good growth performance under the feeding conditions of G.lemaneiformis. Finally, compared with common abalones, orange-muscle abalones had a notably enhanced ability to accumulate carotenoids through their diet, especially zeaxanthin (P<0.01). However, the growth performance of orange-muscle abalones was lower than those of common abalones fed the same diets. These results inferred that the content of carotenoid in abalone may be controlled by genetic factors, and diet had a significant influence on the accumulation of carotenoid in abalone to some extent. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145930110

Sargassum horneri (Turner) C. Agardh blooms (pelagic) have been observed in Jeju Island (Korea) and the southwest of the Korean Peninsula, causing serious problems for seaweed and abalone farms as well as for fisheries, tourism and recreational industries. The present study explored the physiological responses of attached and pelagic S. horneri populations cultivated under different nutrient concentrations (HN: 50 μM of nitrogen and 5 μM of phosphorus; LN: 5 μM of nitrogen and 0.5 μM of phosphorus) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (H-PAR: 250; M-PAR: 150; L-PAR: 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1) for 25 days. Relative growth rates (RGR) were significantly lower in the pelagic population than that in the attached population. All thalli from the pelagic population died within 20 days. Chlorophyll a and c, and carotenoids were significantly higher at HN than at LN, and decreased as PAR increased for both populations. For the attached population, photosynthetic rate, tissue nitrogen, and carbon and nitrogen removal were also significantly higher at HN than at LN. These results suggest that high nutrient and lower PAR increased the biomass accumulation of attached populations in coastal areas.

However, it is currently still unknown how these two important components of benthic food webs will react to a warming environment. Consumption rates of grazers change with increasing temperatures, but it is unclear whether this is also true for feeding preferences. In this study, multiple-choice feeding assays with the tropical abalone Haliotis squamata from Western Indonesia were conducted in August 2018. After brief acclimation of either the grazer or the macroalgae to moderately elevated water temperatures (maximum 2 °C above the long-term average) in the laboratory, three species of living macroalgae were simultaneously offered to the abalone in feeding assays. Consumption rates of H. squamata were lower under elevated water temperatures, while its feeding preference switched: At 27 °C (2 °C below long-term average), abalone preferred non-acclimated Gracilaria salicornia, but switched to non-acclimated Amphiroa spp. at 31 °C. Interestingly, no such switch in preference occurred when the macroalgae, but not the grazers were acclimated. This indicates that the grazer will presumably be the driver of this potential change in interactions between H. squamata and its macroalgal food.

This study integrates field and experimental data into a mass balance food web model of a temperate coastal ecosystem to determine the impacts of specific OA forcing mechanisms as well as how they interact with one another. Specifically, we forced a food web model of a kelp forest ecosystem near its southern distribution limit in the California large marine ecosystem to a 0.5 pH drop over the course of 50 years. This study utilizes a modeling approach to determine the impacts of specific OA forcing mechanisms as well as how they interact. Isolating OA impacts on growth (Production), mortality (Other Mortality), and predation interactions (Vulnerability) or combining all three mechanisms together leads to a variety of ecosystem responses, with some taxa increasing in abundance and other decreasing. Results suggest that carbonate mineralizing groups such as coralline algae, abalone, snails, and lobsters display the largest decreases in biomass while macroalgae, urchins, and some larger fish species display the largest increases. Low trophic level groups such as giant kelp and brown algae increase in biomass by 16% and 71%, respectively. Due to the diverse way in which OA stress manifests at both individual and population levels, ecosystem-level effects can vary and display nonlinear patterns. Combined OA forcing leads to initial increases in ecosystem and commercial biomasses followed by a decrease in commercial biomass below initial values over time, while ecosystem biomass remains high. Both biodiversity and average trophic level decrease over time. These projections indicate that the kelp forest community would maintain high productivity with a 0.5 drop in pH, but with a substantially different community structure characterized by lower biodiversity and relatively greater dominance by lower trophic level organisms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104776191

Trophic mismatches caused by changes in consumer energetics during periods of low resource availability have received far less attention, although this may be common for consumers during winter when primary producers are limited by light. Even less is understood about these dynamics in marine ecosystems, where consumers must cope with energetically costly changes in CO<inf>2</inf>-driven carbonate chemistry that will be most pronounced in cold temperatures. This may be especially important for calcified marine herbivores, such as the pinto abalone (Haliotis kamschatkana). H. kamschatkana are of high management concern in the North Pacific due to the active recreational fishery and their importance among traditional cultures, and research suggests they may require more energy to maintain their calcified shells and acid/base balance with ocean acidification. Here we use field surveys to demonstrate seasonal mismatches in the exposure of marine consumers to low pH and algal resource identity during winter in a subpolar, marine ecosystem. We then use these data to test how the effects of exposure to seasonally relevant pH conditions on H. kamschatkana are mediated by seasonal resource identity. We find that exposure to projected future winter pH conditions decreases metabolism and growth, and this effect on growth is pronounced when their diet is limited to the algal species available during winter. Our results suggest that increases in the energetic demands of pinto abalone caused by ocean acidification during winter will be exacerbated by seasonal shifts in their resources. These findings have profound implications for other marine consumers and highlight the importance of considering fluctuations in exposure and resources when inferring the emergent effects of global change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097839885

Of the major shellfish poisoning syndromes associated with HABs, Paralytic and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP and DSP) pose the greatest concern, but as documented herein there are several other HAB organisms that are also present. Blooms of Alexandrium catenella have been recognised as the typical cause of PSP since 1948. In addition to the risk posed to human health A. catenella has also been the cause of large shellfish and bird mortalities. An additional risk of PSP is provided by Alexandrium minutum first detected in Cape Town harbour in 2003. DSP was identified on the South African coast for the first time in 1991. Although several Dinophysis spp. known to cause DSP have been recognized as a component of the plankton of the region, it is accepted that DSP is usually attributed to D. acuminata or D. fortii. In the southern Benguela both Pseudo-nitzschia australis and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries have been identified and shown to produce domoic acid. Multiple Pseudo-nitzschia spp. have been identified in the northern Benguela with the potentially toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia pungens and P. australis dominant inshore. The yessotoxin (YTX) producing dinoflagellates Gonyaulax spinifera, Lingulodinium polyedrum and Protoceratium reticulatum are all known to form blooms and YTXs have been the cause of massive mortalities of farmed abalone. Prominent fish-killing blooms include Karlodinium veneficum in the northern Benguela and Karenia cristata in the southern Benguela. Shellfish farms in an embayment of the southern Benguela have suffered reduced growth rates due to the ecosystem disruptive blooms of Aureococcus anophagefferens. High biomass dinoflagellate blooms often attributed to Tripos and Prorocentrum spp. characterise the entire region and major mortalities of marine life are regularly attributed to their decay and the subsequent development of anoxic conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090122498

The inclusion of dried macroalgal meals in formulated diets may also provide other benefits such as improvement in growth, health and survival. In this 92 d study, energy allocation in Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata, fed either a commercial diet, the control diet (0% macroalgae meal inclusion), or diets containing three inclusion levels (5, 10 and 20%) of either of two enriched macroalgae meals, Gracilaria cliftonii and Ulva sp., was investigated. Energy budget models, which also accounted for shell growth energy and mucus production energy, were determined for each diet. Results varied in relation to energy budget components and diets. Overall, abalone fed the enriched G. cliftonii ingested significantly more dietary energy and exhibited higher somatic growth energy compared to those fed the commercial diet, the 0% control diet or the enriched Ulva sp. diets. Additionally, ingested feed energy decreased while somatic growth energy tended to increase with increasing enriched G. cliftonii meal inclusion level. In contrast, inclusion at any level with enriched Ulva sp. meal did not result in an improvement of somatic growth energy compared to the commercial or the 0% control diet. For ingested feed energy, 20% enriched Ulva sp. meal inclusion resulted in significantly higher values compared to either the commercial diet, control diet or the two other enriched Ulva sp. meal diets. However, abalone fed the 20% dried Ulva sp. meal diet lost significantly more energy through faecal egestion than those fed the commercial or the 0% control diets, suggesting reduced diet digestibility with increasing enriched Ulva sp. inclusion. The majority of ingested feed energy was allocated to somatic growth across treatments, while shell growth energy accounted for the smallest proportion of the energy budgets. Results suggest that the inclusion of enriched G. cliftonii meal (10% inclusion optimum) in formulated diets for Greenlip Abalone has energetic benefits for feed utilisation and growth which may lead to improved business productivity.

The effects of modified clay on the survival, growth, nutritional quality, and oxidative stress indicators of abalone were studied based on both laboratory and field experiments. The results showed that modified clay at 3–10 times the concentrations used for HAB treatment did not affect the survival of abalone. During the laboratory experiments, the increases in abalone shell length and weight nonsignificantly decreased with increasing concentrations of modified clay at 1–15 d, whereas the weight of abalone in the experimental groups increased rapidly during the recovery period at 16–30 d. The growth and nutrition qualities of abalone in field experiments showed negligible differences between the control and experimental groups. Catalase (CAT) activity in the hepatopancreas and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the gills were significantly affected by certain concentrations of modified clay at individual time points, whereas the malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased in all experimental groups within 96 h. The removal of bacteria and the mitigation of water quality decline were among the effects of modified clay that contributed to the decrease in MDA content.

Since then there have been considerable changes. There are three main uses of kelp (mostly Ecklonia maxima, with some Laminaria pallida) in South Africa. The collection of wash-up for drying and exporting for alginate extraction has drastically reduced to very small amounts in recent years. The boat harvest of fresh kelp for abalone feed in land-based farms has reached a plateau of between 4000 and 5000 t fresh per annum. The diver harvest of E. maxima for agricultural liquid plant growth enhancer shows a constant increase over several years, is still growing, and is currently over 3000 t fresh per annum. The small intertidal collection of Gelidium pristoides as export for agar production has maintained a small, sustainable production of around 100 t dry for many years. Former Gracilaria industries in sheltered bays in both South Africa and Namibia have collapsed, and there is currently no commercial collection. There was commercial raft aquaculture production of Gracilaria in Lüderitz Bay, Namibia for a number of years, but this is no longer practised. Currently, the only commercial seaweed use in Namibia is of L. pallida. Annually, ca. 150 t of fresh wash-up is collected, in Lüderitz, to be used as feed in land-based abalone aquaculture. There are a number of small start-up companies experimenting with seaweed products for cosmetics and nutritional products in both countries, some involving species of Ulva and Porphyra. The former species is a major aquaculture product, with around 2000 t fresh yr-1 being produced in integrated land-based systems with abalone. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089099734

The biomass of the kelp along this coast drastically varies each year due to variable environmental factors, i.e., seawater temperature and nutrient concentrations, during the period of kelp germination. We carried out a field investigation to elucidate how the gonad production fluctuates in an environment where the kelp production varies each year. Seaweed biomass and gonad weight of the sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus were examined monthly from March 2015 through December 2018. The kelp was abundant and the gonad index (= gonad ∕ body weight × 100) of the sea urchins reached more than 20% in 2015. However, in the following 3 years (2016 to 2018), the kelp was nearly absent from the area and the maximum gonad index was significantly less than that in the kelp-abundant year (2015). During the kelp-scarce 3 years, the gonad index showed a significant decrease from one kelp-scarce year to another, indicating that the effect of a poor algal growth on the gonad production of sea urchins was cumulative over the following years. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079491081

Very few studies have focused on the individual consistency of foraging behaviour in marine herbivores. Because marine ectotherms are strongly influenced by their environment and because a mixed diet is appropriate for herbivores, we hypothesized that Haliotis tuberculata, a large marine gastropod, would not exhibit significant individual consistency in foraging activity and would display generalist food choices. To test these hypotheses, the behaviour of 120 abalone was studied using a choice test of eight macroalgal species over 3 weeks, with video recording 24 hr a day. In addition, primary components, secondary metabolites and toughness of the eight algae were measured. At the population level, food choice was mainly related to the protein composition and the toughness of the macroalgae. We found that H. tuberculata is a generalist species feeding on a variety of algae (IS = 0.64), even if 21% of the individuals can be considered to be specialists. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, highly consistent between-individual variation was observed in foraging activity (ICC = 0.81 for time spent feeding and ICC = 0.74 for number of feeding visits per day). The high individual consistency of foraging activity has some ecological and evolutionary implications currently not understood for this marine herbivore. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080874815

The tested S. intermedius was divided into two types: large-size (3 cm test diameter) and small-size (1 cm test diameter). Using the existing abalone breeding facilities, we regularly fed Laminaria japonica and Gracilaria lemaneiformis. After six months of breeding, the test diameter of large-size S. intermedius bred in Fuzhou had reached (55.90±2.63) mm, while the body mass had reached (56.30±6.92) g and the gonadal index reached (15.02±1.5)%. The gonadal development entered the stage of premature (Stage III) with good quality, which was significantly greater than the test diameter (46.56±3.88) mm and body mass (39.07±5.05) g for S. intermedius bred in Dalian in the same period (P<0.05).

Thus, it is suggested that seasonally breeding S. intermedius in the coastal areas of Fujian Province in winter and spring is feasible. Feeding with local fresh algae on basis of existing facilities and abalone cages leads to higer growth rate of S. intermedius than those bred in Dalian in the same period. The important way to meet the increasing market demand of S. intermedius is to move the breeding southward along Fujian coast. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085944459

Drift capture is a trait shared by at least several other abalone species. Drift materials are entrapped beneath the anterior foot and held for ingestion. The quantitative significance of feeding on entrapped drift macrodetritus for black abalone is unknown. Furthermore, there are no published data on the extent to which local and mesoscale spatial distributions of source plant populations influence the composition of drift plant material in black abalone diet as acquired by entrapment. From February 1982 through March 2019, occurrences of macrodetrital entrapment by black abalone were observed in nine rocky intertidal study plots, with a summed surface area of 2,054 m2, on the periphery of San Nicolas Island (SNI), California (Island centroid at â&circ;¼33.25°,-119.50°). A small preliminary survey and 27 complete surveys were performed during the study period (mean of â&circ;¼1.4 y between complete surveys). During the study, more than 1.5 × 105 black abalone were examined. The total likely included repeated observations of many individuals as a result of the known longevity and limited mobility of the species. Of those observed, â&circ;¼1.65 × 103 black abalone were recorded as apparently ingesting entrapped items. Frequency data were dominated (â&circ;¼95% of all records) by three species of kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh; commonly known as ""giant kelp"", Egregia menziesii (Turner), and Eisenia arborea Areschoug. Of those, giant kelp was the most frequently observed entrapped category (â&circ;¼76%). Living, attached giant kelp is rarely observed in intertidal habitats at SNI, and it follows that utilization of giant kelp by black abalone requires physical importation of the kelp from other locations. Frequencies of occurrence of giant kelp entrapment by individual study site were clearly associated with the relative surface canopy sizes and persistence patterns of offshore kelp forests adjacent (≤2 km) to the respective study sites. The pattern suggests that subsidies of drift giant kelp to black abalone diet involve mesoscale physical processes largely proximate to SNI but probably not subsidies from more distant locations such as other islands or the California mainland. Utilization of other frequently recorded kelps as food by black abalone likely involves spatial subsidies as well, but on smaller scales of distance (â&circ;¼10-100 m for E. arborea; â&circ;¼0-100 m for E. menziesii). In the context of the imperiled status of black abalone, recovery actions may include outplants of captive-reared animals or transplantation of wild animals from other populations. For such actions, data from SNI suggest a need for consideration of scales of separation among release locations and nearby populations of the three apparently predominant kelp species in black abalone diet. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083746015

However, large amounts of unused portions of the algae are incinerated as trash or dumped in the sea, causing pollution. Recycling algae is important for saving resources and conserving the environment. In this study, the fucoidan which is a major carbohydrate of marine algae was tested as a source of fertilizer for farming. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth rate of the melon was examined after treating fucoidan and the melon growth factors, weight and length of stem were measured. To discover the mechanism of melon growth promotion of fucoidan, bacteria that decomposed fucoidan were isolated from soil and abalone. Bacillus wiedmannii and Stenotrophomonas pavanii were isolated from terrestrial soil and Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from abalone. Among these three bacteria, Pseudomonas sp. had the highest and most specific fucoidan-decomposing activity. When Pseudomonas sp. was treated with fucoidan on melon-growing soil, the growth of melon was relatively improved compared to the treatment with fucoidan alone. CONCLUSION: We found that fucoidan, the main carbohydrate of marine algae, promoted melon growth. Fucoidan-decomposing microorganisms were isolated from terrestrial soil and marine organism, and we found that these bacteria stimulated the effect of melon growth promotion of marine algae. This is the first report that confirms the fertilizer effect of marine algae and shows the use of bacteria with marine algae. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153937267

In California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico), overfishing and climate change-linked diseases are thought to be responsible for mass mortalities and significant declines in abalone fisheries landings. Conservation aquaculture is an option for enhancing abalone populations through captive propagation and cage mariculture with subsequent restockings into the wild. To test, inform, and promote innovative sustainable seafood production strategies in the Northeastern Pacific, we designed an experimental mariculture system at San Jeronimo Island, Baja California. We explored the feasibility of rearing juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, in a near-shore mariculture cage-based production system to supply individuals for local restoration programs. We tested the effects of 2 different depths, surface and bottom (5 m), and 3 macroalgal diets (Macrocystis pyrifera, Eisenia arborea, and a mixed diet of Pelagophycus porra with M. pyrifera) on the survival and growth of juvenile red abalone (32 ± 3.33 mm in shell length) inside cages attached to a long-line system. Over the 90-d experiment, survival was 99% for the surface treatment and 95% for the bottom treatment. Mean daily increment in shell length was 93 ± 12 µm·d–1 in surface cages and 82 ± 13 µm·d–1 in bottom cages. Depth did not affect growth or survival. Growth was highest using the E. arborea diet (99 ± 7 µm·d–1) but not significantly different from the M. pyrifera and mixed diets (88 ± 10 and 74 ± 13 µm·d–1, respectively). High survivorship and growth indicate that San Jeronimo Island can support cage-based mariculture of red abalone and that this strategy may be a useful tool in developing climate-resilient abalone restoration solutions aimed at bolstering seafood production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099856446

In this study, the impact of this mode on the nutritive compositions of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) was investigated.The main method was the series of GB.5009. The determined indexes include moisture, cholesterol, ash, protein, lipid, glycogen, collagen, mineral elements(Mg, Al, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se),delicious amino acids(aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, arginine, methionine, lysine),taurine and fatty acid. SPSS 24.0 statistical software(independent sample t-test)was used to determine the significance of the differences between two groups. The experimental results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.Two groups of adult abalone(two years old)with the same algae diet (Gracilaria lemaneiformis) were sampled for the analysis in December, 2017. One group was cultured in Lianjiang, Fujian (Southern China) without migration (LJ-DD) and the other was moved to Shandong (Northern China) before the summer and returned to Lianjiang in November (SD-DD).

For amino acid profile, the contents of glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and total delicious amino acid were significantly higher in LJ-DD than in SD-DD. Besides, taurine content was significantly lower in SD-DD than in LJ-DD. For fatty acid profile, C20:3n6 content was significantly higher in LJ-DD than in SD-DD.

The dynamics, processes, environment and management of semi-intensive (several tons ha-1 y-1) mariculture IMTA started in the early 1970s, at the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat, with several models that combined flow-through and recirculation features between primary (fed) and secondary (extractive) species. The seawater fishponds differed from freshwater ponds mainly in the continuous exchange with water from the open sea, to stabilize salinity and other water quality features. The primary (fed) fish was mostly the seabream (Sparus aurata), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus) and mullets (Mugil cephalus and Liza ramada). At first, the extractive component included microalgae, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and clams (Ruditapes philippnmarum). In more progressive models, plastic-lined double drain ponds and tanks are used. Several other species, for example: clams, seaweed (the macroalgae Ulva spp. and Gracilaria spp.), abalone (Haliotis tuberculata and H. discus hannai), sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Tripneustes gratilla elatensis), shrimp, brine shrimp (Artemia salina) are used. Wetlands planted with the halophytes Salicornia sp. and Sarcocrnia sp. have been integrated as IMTA. Recently, periphyton and drip-irrigated algal biofilters were examined and found to be practical. The research contributed to the enhancement of the sustainability, flexibility and potential for profitability of the aquaculture operation, based on the accumulated understanding about the functioning of the different units and the interactions between them. The principles developed in this research are relevant to brackishwater aquaculture, and have been applied for shrimp culture, mainly in China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074826092

As abalone is herbivorous, the use of local collected algae as feed may appear advantageous. The nutritional value of eight monospecific seaweed diets was studied using Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), filamentous algae, mainly Gracilaria sp. (Rhodophyta), Enteromorpha sp. and Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta), together with Saccharina latissima, Saccorhiza polyschides, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria hyperborea (Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae) and a mixed macroalgal diet. An integrative approach consisted in monitoring the seasonal composition changes of these algae in terms of protein, lipid, soluble carbohydrate, fatty acid and amino-acid contents, and to relate it to seasonal growth and reproduction investment during a large-scale experiment. Abalone and algae were studied for one year in commercial sea-cage structures. Abalone fed with monospecific diet using either P. palmata or S. latissima, and with mixed diet presented the best growth rate, muscle ratio and gonad development. Seasonal daily weight gain was mainly associated with n-3/n-6 ratio, soluble carbohydrate content and total protein content. In term of amino-acid contents, the daily weight gain was associated with free phenylalanine as well as isoleucine levels. Moreover, 90% of 2-years old abalone started gonad development but less than a quarter featured a fully matured gonad. The gonad development of H. tuberculata was mostly associated to total valine, methionine, leucine, arginine and isoleucine levels. The age of initial sexual maturity in H. tuberculata turned to be a highly plastic trait in response to different growth rates and algal diets. Even if P. palmata is the best option for growth performance, mixed diets should probably be preferred to a monospecific diet in order to avoid too high pressure on a single algal resource. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070622642

Over the same period and similar geographic area, a prolonged and widespread marine mortality event occurred. From January to May 2013, low level rates of incidental morbidity and mortality of abalone (Haliotis rubra and H. laevigata) and at least 29 fish species were observed. Mortalities were geographically extensive from Port MacDonnell on the South Coast of South Australia to Point Drummond on Eyre Peninsula, and including two gulf systems, spanning approximately 2,900 km of coastline. Mortalities were investigated using gross pathology, histopathology, bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. Water samples were collected to assess water column nutrient status and phytoplankton biomass levels and community composition. High nutrient concentrations were suggestive of high phytoplankton productivity, with conditions conducive to diatom blooms. A harmful (abrasive) diatom, Chaetoceros coarctatus, was observed in higher concentrations than the historical average. Observed fish mortalities were restricted to a small proportion of the populations and primarily comprised of temperate small-bodied benthic inshore species. Fish histopathology was suggestive of prolonged stress (melanomacrophage aggregation in spleens and kidneys), physical gill damage (focal gill lesions likely caused by C. coarctatus) and lethal bacterial septicaemia. Infectious and notifiable diseases were ruled out in all fish and abalone samples. Abalone mortalities were also restricted to a small proportion of the population with thermal stress a likely contributing factor that resulted in terminal secondary bacterial infections. A marine heatwave event, which promoted blooms of algae, including C. coarctatus, was likely the primary cause of widespread marine mortalities throughout South Australia in 2013. With marine heatwaves projected to increase in frequency, duration and spatial extent, this investigation demonstrated that most at risk will be temperate species in shallow water habitats already at their upper thermal tolerance limits, particularly those with high site fidelity. This should be considered in future climate proofing strategies, including risk and impact assessments underpinning the management of marine resources, fisheries, aquaculture and ecotourism. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074136296

The growth rates and Se contents increased significantly in abalones fed with Se-enriched G. lemaneiformis, while the toxicity of Cd was reduced. Seven to 12 days Cd exposure to the Se-enriched G. lemaneiformis not only affected GPx activity but the MT levels fluctuated irregularly. MT concentrations increased after 3 days exposure and then gradually decreased to the control level after Day 7. There were statistically significant positive correlations between MT levels, GPx activity and Se concentrations, and negative relationships between MT levels, GPx activity and Cd levels in abalones.

Further development of the sector will affect the provision of ecosystem services that maintain the livelihood of local populations. In particular, the current size and growth rate of China's mariculture has raised many environmental concerns, but very few studies of this sector have been conducted to date. Here, we report the resource use in the production of six main Chinese mariculture products (Larimichthys crocea, Apostichopus japonicus, Haliotis spp., Laminaria japonica, Gracilaria spp., Porphyra spp.), taking the city of Ningde as a case study. We used the life cycle assessment framework and the Cumulated Exergy Demand indicator to quantify resource use, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation where model uncertainty was included using various methods. The mean exergy demand values of the production of one live-weight ton of large yellow croaker, sea cucumber, abalone, laminaria, gracilaria, and porphyra are 106 GJ eq., 65 GJ eq., 126 GJ eq., 0.25 GJ eq., 1.55 GJ eq., and 0.98 GJ eq., respectively. For animal products, 45-90% of the impacts come from the feed requirements, while in seaweed production, 83-99% of the impacts are linked to the fuel used in operation and maintenance activities. Policies oriented toward efficient resource management in the mariculture sector thus should take the farm design, input management, and spatial planning of marine areas as the main targets to guide current practices into more sustainable ones in the future. Improvements in all those aspects can effectively increase resource efficiency in local mariculture production and additionally reduce other environmental impacts both locally and globally. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062817276

Thus, our results suggest that kelp will benefit from ocean acidification by a reduction in environmental stress however; iodine levels, in kelp-based coastal food webs will increase, with potential impacts on biogeochemical cycles of iodine in coastal ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056826005

As H. discus hannai primarily feed on brown algae and largely extract their energy from algal polysaccharides, understanding the mechanisms by which they digest algal polysaccharides is essential for elucidating their energy metabolism. Gut microbes, as well as the host animal, are involved in the process of polysaccharide degradation. To identify algal polysaccharide-digestion mechanisms and their origin, we analyzed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of abalone visceral extracts. Microbial communities were characterized using the 16S rRNA gene sequences in the metagenome and our results differed significantly from those of previous studies using traditional microbiological methods such as bacterial cultivation and cloning. A greater diversity of bacterial taxa was identified here than was previously identified using cultivation methods. Furthermore, the most abundant bacterial taxa also differed from previous studies, which is not common when comparing the results of bacterial culturing with those of molecular methodologies. Based on the metatranscriptome, overall functions were identified and additional analyses were performed on the coding sequences of algal polysaccharide-digestive enzymes, including alginate lyase. Results of the transcriptomic analyses suggest that alginate lyase in the visceral extracts of H. discus hannai was produced by the host itself, not by visceral bacteria. This is the first next-generation sequencing study performed on abalone to characterize the visceral microbiota and the source of the ability to digest algal polysaccharides by analyzing the metagenome and metatranscriptome together. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054756114

Dietary inclusion effect of the combined macroalgae (MA) (Undaria pinnatifida and Hizikia fusiforme) and a single Saccharina japonica on abalone was also compared. Three thousand six hundred juvenile abalone were purchased from a private hatchery and acclimated to the experimental conditions for 2weeks. Six 5-ton flow-through raceway tanks were used, and abalone were randomly distributed into tanks (n=600 per tank). Three experimental diets were prepared in duplicate. Fish meal, FSM, corn gluten meal, and shrimp meal and wheat flour and dextrin were used as the protein and carbohydrate sources, respectively, in the FSM diet. MA was also included in the FSM diet. FSM and MA in the FSM diet were substituted with SBM at the expense of wheat flour and S. japonica, referred to as the SBM and SJ diets. The experimental diets were pelletized by an extruded pelleter. Water stability of nutrients in the experimental diets was monitored at 12, 24, and 48h after seawater immersion. The experimental diets were fed to abalone once a day to satiation with a little leftover for 120days. The retained crude protein and lipid and ash content of the extruded pellets were changed over all period of time. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of abalone fed the SBM diet were greater than those of abalone fed the FSM and SJ diets. Weight gain and SGR of abalone fed the SJ diet were also greater than those of abalone fed the FSM diet. The longest shell length, widest shell width, highest shell height, and greatest soft body weight were obtained in abalone fed the SBM diet, followed by the SJ and FSM diets. Proximates of the soft body of abalone were not different among the experimental diets. In conclusion, SBM was a superior protein source to FSM in extruded pellet for growth performance of abalone.

In this study, instead of extracting polysaccharides (PUs) from U. prolifera, algae powder was used directly as the primary carbon source in a fermentation medium. Five percent (5%) algae powder was more conducive to fermentation. Using submerged liquid fermentation, the soluble components of U. prolifera were released efficiently in a 50-L fermenter. Levels of mannitol acquired using submerged liquid fermentation were 1.8 times higher than those acquired using the hot-water method, and polysaccharides were efficiently hydrolyzed to form oligosaccharides with an average molecular weight of approximately 3300 Da. Furthermore, a 2-month experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of U. prolifera fermentation extracts on the growth performance of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). Diets containing algae fermentation extracts in concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1% significantly increased linear shell growth rate (LGR), weight growth rate (WGR), and specific growth rate (SGR). Diets supplemented with fermentation extracts in concentrations of 0.5 and 1% significantly increased the degree of green coloration in the shell.

The remaining three diets had different 1:1 mixtures of the algal species, i.e., L. japonica and U. lactuca (LU), L. japonica and G. lemaneiformis (LG), and U. lactuca and G. lemaneiformis (UG). The FA profiles of the abalone soft body showed clear changes over the experimental period and differed significantly between the different diet groups.

The gut-bacterial composition of Haliotis midae (5-9 mm) weaned onto either a commercial formulated feed (Abfeed-S34), fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima), or a commercial formulated feed containing kelp (E. maxima) (Abfeed-S34K) was compared.

In terrestrial herbivores, the digestive microbiota is known to degrade complex polysaccharides from land plants while in marine herbivores, the digestive microbiota is poorly characterized. Most of the latter are generalists and consume red, green, and brown macroalgae, three distinct lineages characterized by a specific composition in complex polysaccharides, which represent half of their biomass. Subsequently, each macroalga features a specific epiphytic microbiota, and the digestive microbiota of marine herbivores is expected to vary with a monospecific algal diet. We investigated the effect of four monospecific diets (Palmaria palmata, Ulva lactuca, Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) on the composition and specificity of the digestive microbiota of a generalist marine herbivore, the abalone, farmed in a temperate coastal area over a year. The microbiota from the abalone digestive gland was sampled every 2 months and explored using metabarcoding. RESULTS: Diversity and multivariate analyses showed that patterns of the microbiota were significantly linked to seasonal variations of contextual parameters but not directly to a specific algal diet. Three core genera: Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio constantly dominated the microbiota in the abalone digestive gland. Additionally, a less abundant and diet-specific core microbiota featured genera representing aerobic primary degraders of algal polysaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the establishment of a persistent core microbiota in the digestive gland of the abalone since its juvenile state and the presence of a less abundant and diet-specific core community. While composed of different microbial taxa compared to terrestrial herbivores, the digestive gland constitutes a particular niche in the abalone holobiont, where bacteria (i) may cooperate to degrade algal polysaccharides to products assimilable by the host or (ii) may have acquired these functions through gene transfer from the aerobic algal microbiota.

After a long period of cultivation, several varieties of S. japonica have been developed in Korea and China. In this study, we conducted aquacultural research on the persistence of thalli from two kelp cultivars, one from China (Huangguan No. 1) and one from Korea (Sugwawon No. 301), between December 2015 and November 2016 in Haenam, Korea. The maximum length was 247.8 ± 13.0 and 227.5 ± 42.0 cm, respectively, which were significantly longer in Sugwawon No. 301 than in Huangguan No. 1. The maximum width was 29.9 ± 5.4 and 23.2 ± 1.9 cm, respectively, which were significantly wider in Huangguan No. 1 than in Sugwawon No. 301. The mean biomass obtained from the culture ropes was for Sugwawon No. 301 was 3.5 ± 0.3 kg wet wt m-1 and for while Huangguan No. 1 was 3.1 ± 1.0 kg wet wt m-1 of culture rope. After August, the persistence of the thalli of Sugwawon No. 301 was two months longer than that of Huangguan No. 1. We found that the Sugwawon No. 301 performed as well as the Huangguan No. 1 in Korean waters possibly due to increased flexibility as a result of the different cell arrangements of the two cultivars. Overall, the use of the Sugwawon No. 301 cultivar rather than the Huangguan No. 1 cultivar of S. japonica appears the best alternative to help to ensure a stable year round algal feed supply for the Korean abalone industry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044338097

Abalone recruitment is related to the algal community type, with abalone shifting with growth from deeper crustose coralline algal (CCA) habitats to shallower kelp bed habitats via algal turfs. Timing of the habitat shifts is linked to ontogenetic changes in diet, from benthic diatoms to a diet dominated by macroalgae. Susceptibility to predation appears to change, concomitant with the shift from cryptic microhabitats during early-life stages to more exposed habitats during latter-life stages. Interstitial spaces between cobbles and boulders in the CCA habitat are considered to be important for reducing predation risk. The loss of CCA nursery habitat through sedimentation and macroalgal overgrowth likely negatively affects abalone recruitment. Preservation of diverse algal communities, including suitable habitats for the different abalone growth stages, is critical for successful abalone recruitment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041904499

Various combinations of red algae (Palmaria palmata, Ceramium rubrum and Chondrus crispus cultured or harvested from the natural environment, as well as Porphyra spp. collected), brown algae (Laminaria digitata) and green algae (fresh or frozen Ulva intestinalis) were tested. The results showed that P. palmata, C. rubrum and U. intestinalis administered alone were associated with significantly higher weight growth rates than the other species of algae tested. However, some combinations of algae (i.e. different proportions of L. digitata in association with P. palmata) were more favorable for weight increase when compared with the expected rates calculated for the diet based on L. digitata alone. Limiting the amount of any of these foods substantially reduced the conversion rate. Seasonal trends were apparent in both weight increase and food conversion rates, with the result that growth in weight on a diet of L. digitata was fastest in summer. Growth on P. palmata was faster in each season, and reached a maximum in early spring. The data collected allowed us to model weight increase and month-to-month food conversion rates for a diet based on P. palmata and L. digitata. The data obtained in this study were coupled with data regarding the availability of algae during the year, enabling us to suggest an optimal diet for each of the four seasons. Finally, the effects of different algae diets were investigated on hemocyte parameters, and the result suggested that P. palmata would reinforce the immune system of abalone. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054977533

In a 90-day study, the growth and nutrient utilization of juvenile greenlip abalone (1.82 g, 23.23 mm) fed diets containing Ulva sp. protein extract (UPE) were investigated. Animals were fed one of the four formulated test diets containing graded levels of UPE (0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) or a commercial diet that served as a control for the 0% basal diet. Diets were formulated to contain 37% crude protein, 5% lipid, and 17.5 MJ/kg gross energy. The specific growth rate and shell growth rate (μm/day) of abalone fed the four experimental diets were similar. Dietary inclusions of UPE supported the growth of juvenile greenlip abalone and may be used to reduce dietary inclusions of solvent extracted soybean meal, dehulled lupins, and wheat flour. Currently, UPE is cost prohibitive for commercial use in greenlip abalone diet. As UPE is a by-product of the macroalgae industry, the cost of UPE would likely become more economically viable as macroalgae production increases in the future to include in diets for greenlip abalone. Once economically viable, we recommend a dietary inclusion of up to 20% UPE meal for greenlip abalone. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043785842

One important question is whether OA will alter species interactions. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) provide space and chemical cues for larval settlement. CCA have shown strongly negative responses to OA in previous studies, including disruption of settlement cues to corals. In California, CCA provide cues for seven species of harvested, threatened, and endangered abalone. We exposed four common CCA genera and a crustose calcifying red algae, Peyssonnelia (collectively CCRA) from California to three pCO<inf>2</inf> levels ranging from 419-2,013 μatm for four months. We then evaluated abalone (Haliotis rufescens) settlement under ambient conditions among the CCRA and non-Algal controls that had been previously exposed to the pCO<inf>2</inf> treatments. Abalone settlement and metamorphosis increased from 11% in the absence of CCRA to 45-69% when CCRA were present, with minor variation among CCRA genera. Though all CCRA genera reduced growth during exposure to increased pCO<inf>2</inf>, abalone settlement was unaffected by prior CCRA exposure to increased pCO<inf>2</inf>. Thus, we find no impacts of OA exposure history on CCRA provision of settlement cues. Additionally, there appears to be functional redundancy in genera of CCRA providing cues to abalone, which may further buffer OA effects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025129057

Production has continually increased, and approximately 442,637 tonnes wet weight was harvested in Korea in 2015. Abalone is a highly sought-after delicacy in Korea, and the abalone farming industry has been developed based on a stable production of seaweed. Korean abalone farmers prefer to feed their stock on locally cultured S. japonica; however, between August and November, the supply of farmed S. japonica declines because higher seawater temperatures reduce S. japonica productivity. In an attempt to overcome this temperature-induced period of low production, cultivation trials with a strain of S. japonica selected to withstand higher cultivation temperatures were undertaken. Strain selection involved using individual parent thalli that were found to remain productive under high seawater temperature (26 °C) at Wando. Male and female gametophytes were isolated through 3 cycles of free-living gametophyte culture to produce the F<inf>3</inf> strain used in the production trials. Production trials using the selected strain were initiated every month between December 2014 and March 2015. This delayed the initiation of culture beyond the latest initiation time currently used by farmers (December). Delaying initiation of cultivation resulted in delayed maximum growth compared to the control. Growth of the F<inf>3</inf> strain continued for up to 3 months longer than normally achieved on farms for non-selected thalli. The mean length, growth rate, and biomass were also greater than those achieved by the control strain. The use of the F<inf>3</inf> strain of S. japonica coupled with delayed initiation of culture can therefore be used to help to ensure a stable year round algal feed supply for abalone industry in Korea. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020059759

Although mixotrophy elevates the growth rate of T. helix by 79%–185%, its absolute growth rate is still as low as 0.3 d−1. Thus, if the mortality rate of T. helix due to predation is high, this dinoflagellate may not easily prevail. To investigate potential effective protistan grazers on T. helix, feeding by diverse heterotrophic dinoflagellates such as engulfment-feeding Oxyrrhis marina, Gyrodinium dominans, Gyrodinium moestrupii, Polykrikos kofoidii, and Noctiluca scintillans, peduncle-feeding Aduncodinium glandula, Gyrodiniellum shiwhaense, Luciella masanensis, and Pfiesteria piscicida, pallium-feeding Oblea rotunda and Protoperidinium pellucidum, and the naked ciliates Pelagostrobilidium sp. (ca. 40 μm in cell length) and Strombidinopsis sp. (ca. 150 μm in cell length) on T. helix was explored. Among the tested heterotrophic protists, O. marina, G. dominans, G. moestrupii, A. glandula, L. masanensis, P. kofoidii, P. piscicida, and Strombidinopsis sp. were able to feed on T. helix. The growth rates of all these predators except Strombidinopsis sp. with T. helix prey were lower than those without the prey. The growth rate of Strombidinopsis sp. on T. helix was almost zero although the growth rate of Strombidinopsis sp. with T. helix prey was higher than those without the prey. Moreover, T. helix fed on O. marina and P. pellucidum and lysed the cells of P. kofoidii and G. shiwhaense. With increasing the concentrations of T. helix, the growth rates of O. marina and P. kofoidii decreased, but those of G. dominans and L. masanensis largely did not change. Therefore, reciprocal predation, lysis, no feeding, and the low ingestion rates of the common protists preying on T. helix may result in a low mortality rate due to predation, thereby compensating for this species’ low growth rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028409990

To explore the possible effect of culture of G. lemaneiformis on algal blooms, field investigations were conducted at different functional cultural zones in this area in March, May and June, 2016. The changes in nutrient contents and compositions were compared before and after the cultivation of G. lemaneiformis and the utilization of organic nutrients by phytoplankton in different-sized fractions were determined through analysis of extracellular enzyme hydrolysis. Results show that the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrient was low, thus the water quality of the studied area was good. The concentration of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) decreased with the increase of the phytoplankton biomass from spring to summer, which in turn changed the studied area into a phosphorus-limited area finally. In May, the DIP concentrations in G. lemaneiformis mono-culture zone and G. lemaneiformis abalone co-culture zones were significantly lower than that in abalone mono-culture and non-culture zone. Furthermore, compared with any of the other zones, the chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration was significantly lower whereas the activities of leucine amino peptidase (LAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were much higher in the G. lemaneiformis mono-culture zone, suggesting that the phytoplankton in this zone suffered from much more nutrient stress. Moreever, chl a content in G. lemaneiformis mono-culture zone increased rapidly after the harvest of G. lemaneiformis. All these results indicate that G. lemaneiformis might inhibit phytoplankton growth by nutrient competition, especially in phosphorus, and thus may depress harmful algal blooms from happening. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061578881

Commercially reared sub-adult abalone fed a kelp-supplemented (Ecklonia maxima; 0.88% dry weight) or kelp-free control feed were collected for analysis of the amylase, alginate lyase, laminarinase, fucoidanase and protease activities in the gut.

However, enzyme-activity levels were more variable in abalone fed the kelp-free diet as compared with those fed the kelp-supplemented diet (coefficients of variation: 73%, 48.3–60.2% and 31.9% [control diet] versus 42.7%, 13.6–33.8% and 14.6% [KS diet] for amylase, macroalgal polysaccharidases and acid protease activity, respectively). We suggest that the presence of dietary kelp modulates the abalone's gut bacteria and their nutrient exchange.

Before the earthquake and tsunami, H. discus hannai of 2007–2010 yr classes were shown to undergo habitat shifts with growth from the crustose coralline algal area (CCA) to kelp beds (KB) via algal turfs (AT). These habitat shifts of abalone appear to occur because of its migration, associated with the ontogenetic changes in feeding behavior. Densities of 0-yr-old juvenile abalone (2010 yr class) and the sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus inhabiting the CCA largely decreased just after the earthquake and tsunami, mainly affected by the catastrophic disturbance by this event. After that, previously unrecorded recruitments of juvenile macroalgae were observed in the CCA after the event probably because of the large-scale removal of the primary herbivore, the sea urchin M. nudus. Subsequently, the KB and AT expanded into the previous CCA area. After the tsunami, the major factors causing the continuously low densities of the 0-yr-old juvenile abalone (2011–2013 yr classes) are inferred to be the limited nursery CCA habitat because of mud and silt sedimentation, the expansion of the KB and AT, and/or the decreased densities of reproductive adult abalone due to the direct disturbance of the tsunami. The results of this study imply that maintaining diverse algal communities which enable the habitat shifts of juvenile abalone H. discus hannai is one of the crucial factors to their successful recruitment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006100142

This led to restrictions on abalone harvesting and triggered continued PST monitoring by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC-FLD) of abalone and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), and concurrent phytoplankton monitoring, between 2011 and 2013. PST up to 2437 μg STX eq kg−1 (three times the bivalve regulatory limit) were confirmed in abalone viscera, with toxicity up to 586 μg STX eq kg−1 in the muscular foot (mainly doSTX and minor proportions of STX and dcSTX). Mussels accumulated PST at a faster rate than abalone which suggests they can serve as sentinels of PST accumulation to inform abalone risk management protocols. Three lines of evidence for G. catenatum as the source of PST in abalone were established: (1) PST in abalone tissues increased and declined in association with dinoflagellate blooms; (2) G. catenatum DNA was detected by real-time PCR in abalone digestive tracts; and (3) the PST analogues (toxin profile) observed in both abalone viscera and mussels were similar suggesting a common PST source.

Two species of dried macroalgae meal (Ulva sp. and Gracilaria cliftonii) at four levels (0% basal diet, 5%, 10% and 20%) of dietary inclusion were fed to the abalone (2.89 ± 0.01 g; shell length 22.41 ± 0.06 mm) for 92 days. The abalone fed G. cliftonii meal developed brown-red colour on the shell and the increased inclusion of algal meal resulted in darker brown shells, whereas abalone fed Ulva sp. meal or the basal diet exhibited light green shells. Although foot hue and foot brightness were not influenced by the type and level of inclusion of dried algal meal, the foot colour saturation of abalone fed ≥ 10% macroalgal meal was significantly higher than those fed the basal diet. Abalone developed a green lip when fed ≥ 10% of G. cliftonii meal, whereas lip colour did not change when fed Ulva sp. meal inclusion, compared to the basal diet, and exhibited milky lip colour. Although diet pigments varied with the species of macroalgae and inclusion level, β-carotene was the major pigment in the tissue of abalone fed all test diets and its content increased significantly with the inclusion level of macroalgae in the diet. Abalone fed the basal diet had significantly lower tissue β-carotene than those fed the diets with macroalgal inclusion. This study suggests that the inclusion of ≥ 5% G. cliftonii can produce a brown-red shell and the inclusion of ≥ 10% G. cliftonii intensifies the green colour of the lip. The brown-red colour mark on the shell by feeding macroalgal meal may be used as a harmless shell-marking method for ranching, stock enhancement or growth study in the wild.

This was followed by polyculture of carp with tilapias, grey mullet, and planktivorous carp. Scientific research on polyculture started in the 1950s and has since contributed to the global science and practice of green water aquaculture, especially with novel polyculture approaches and concepts. Today, the industry is characterized by intensive freshwater polyculture, implemented in earthen fish ponds and reservoirs. In the Mediterranean coastal plain, fresh, brackish, and marine water polyculture is carried out in semi-intensive fishponds. Polyculture in Israel is an entrepreneurial activity that combines ecological principles of Chinese polyculture with local technologies and objectives. The Biofloc approach (active suspension ponds, ASP), periphyton, and aquaponics, were developed in the 1980s in response to rising public and policymakers‘ concerns and regulations on land use, pollution, use of chemicals, and organic manures. R&D on marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems began in the early 1970s at the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat. It started with sea bream and mullet in earthen seawater ponds, whose plankton-rich water recirculated through bivalve and macroalgae biofiltration modules. An advanced form of the concept was deployed in the early 1980s and was studied in detail using nutrient budgets. Several system models with fish, bivalves, and algae, on small and pilot scales, were studied and quantified. Abalone, sea urchins, shrimp, brine shrimp, Salicornia, and periphyton, were added to the Eilat marine IMTA models, beginning in the 1990s. Upon entering the third millennium, Israeli research further examined the relationship between the sustainability and economics of IMTA in world aquaculture. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026898316

Fertilized eggs and larvae were raised at water temperatures of 9°C, 12°C, 15°C, 18°C, and 21°C in two separate trials. The rate of larvae development increased significantly with each 3°C change in temperature.

Feeding behavior was scored in terms of the following activities: quiescence, alertness, moving, feeding, distance traveled, velocity, and homing. There was a significant effect of diet type and temperature on feeding behavior of abalone. Both types of abalone were more active and exhibited the highest velocity when fed the formulated diet at 22°C. Greenlip abalone spent a larger proportion of time feeding on Ulva sp. than on the formulated diet, regardless of the water temperature. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the proportion of time feeding between diet types for hybrid abalone. Both types of abalone rapidly located and consumed Ulva sp. when feed was introduced into the aquaria at 1600 h (light phase). In contrast, abalone predominantly commenced feeding on the formulated diet in the dark phase, indicating the potential of Ulva sp. as feed attractant in abalone diet, to promote feeding. The mode in which abalone consumed feed also differed between diets. Abalone fed the formulated diet nibbled intermittently on random chips, whereas when fed Ulva sp., abalone engulfed entire individual fronds before moving on to the next available frond. Greenlip and hybrid abalone exhibited homing behavior at the completion of the dark phase, which was more pronounced in abalone fed Ulva sp.

In addition, a high number of viable alginate-degrading bacteria were detected throughout the survey period. Alginate-degrading bacteria were more abundant in the cold season relative to the summer season (107 vs. 104 CFU g−1, respectively). Strong positive correlation was also observed between the number of alginate-degrading bacteria and feed intake (R = 0.854; P < 0.01). The identified alginate-degrading bacteria comprised of 35 species grouped into 11 genera including Algibacter, Formosa, Polarybacter, Tamlana, Tenacibaculum (CFB group), Roseobacter, Ruegeria, Silicibacter (α-proteobacteria), Agarivorans, Shewanella and Vibrio (γ-proteobacteria) respectively. More than 80% of the isolated alginate-degrading bacteria belonged to the genus Vibrio, showing high homology to Vibrio cyclotorophicus, Vibrio splendidus, Vibrio halioticoli and Vibrio neonatus. Based on the results, it was suggested that algal-polysaccharide (alginate) degrading bacteria (mainly Vibrio) commonly exist in the gut of abalone and may play an important role in the degradation and digestion of the host's feed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924785492

The goal of this study was to analyse the digestive gland structure of juvenile green abalone fed rehydrated natural feed, Ulva sp.

Structure of the digestive gland was described, and proteoglycan granules were detected in the digestive cells. The abundance of granules was variable, depending on the feed provided to the abalone, and this was reflected in their growth. Granular content in digestive cells fed Ulva sp. was scarce, leading to low growth rate and high feed conversion ratio (FCR). Digestive cells of juveniles fed E. menziesii led to the best nutritional condition, including many proteoglycans cellular granules, best weight growth rate and a low FCR. Histochemical analysis of the digestive gland, differentiated by a modified Goldner trichrome method that included Alcian blue, was a useful tool for determining the nutritional status of farmed abalone, therefore recommended for assessing adjustments to the natural feed or formulation to meet the nutritional needs of abalone. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977473873

Abalone aquaculture is still a developing industry, and at least two major issues, nutrition and health, impede its development. Abalone are fed macroalgae on-farm in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa and Chile. Formulated diets are crucial to the success of abalone aquaculture in countries where abalone do not grow readily when fed brown macroalgae or when access to macroalgae is insufficient for culture. Typically, the growth rate of abalone fed formulated diets is higher than abalone fed live macroalgae. However, due to a long production period, diets for abalone not only need to sustain high growth rates, but also maintain optimal health. Feeding live macroalgae improves the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone. In this review, the nutritional requirements of abalone and dietary ingredients used in formulated diets will be discussed, together with the use of dried macroalgal meal as a dietary ingredient in formulated diets to improve the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone in commercial production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84909617040

Two experiments were conducted over 93. days to test the effect of diet on the colour of the foot and shell of 1-year old greenlip abalone Haliotis laevigata. In Experiment 1, a commercial control diet and two species of fresh macroalgae (. Gracilaria cliftonii and Ulva sp.) were used and each macroalgae species was either non-enriched or enriched with nutrients in the culture media. The shell of abalone fed the commercial diet and fresh Ulva sp. was green but abalone fed fresh G. cliftonii developed a brown shell. The fresh G. cliftonii increased shell colour purity while fresh Ulva sp. increased shell brightness. Feeding abalone with either fresh Ulva or fresh G. cliftonii produced yellowish foot. Nutrient enrichment of algae did not significantly affect the pigment contents in both macroalgae and abalone, and had minimal impact on the colour of shell and foot. With the exception of zeaxanthin, the pigment contents were significantly lower in fresh G. cliftonii than in fresh Ulva sp. Moreover, β-carotene was the main pigment in abalone fed both species of fresh macroalgae. In Experiment 2, the inclusion of dietary dried algae affected abalone colour. Three diets including a commercial control diet, a diet containing 3% dried Spirulina sp. and a diet containing 10% dried Ulva sp. were used. The shell of abalone fed dried Spirulina sp. was yellow-brown with higher colour purity while the shell remained light green in abalone fed dried Ulva sp. or the commercial control diet. The colour of abalone foot became bright yellow when abalone fed dried Ulva sp. Abalone fed dried algae contained β-carotene as the principal pigment. This study indicates that fresh macroalgae and dried algae supplementation in feed can change the colour of abalone foot and shell. Feed effect on shell colour was far more than on tissue colour.

Abalone were fed to excess at 16:00 h daily, and uneaten feed was collected the following morning. Nutrient enrichment increased the protein level for Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii from 5.3 to 27.7% and 12.9 to 38.1%, respectively. The growth of abalone fed G. cliftonii was superior to animals fed Ulva sp. The effect of enrichment was macroalgae species-dependent. While abalone fed enriched Ulva sp. exhibited superior growth to those fed non-enriched Ulva sp., animals fed non-enriched and enriched G. cliftonii exhibited similar growth. However, abalone fed non-enriched G. cliftonii had superior apparent protein deposition and protein efficiency ratio, compared to animals fed enriched G. cliftonii. Feeding an equal mix of Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii had a positive synergistic effect on abalone growth, compared to animals fed mono-specific algae. Abalone fed each commercial diet exhibited improved growth and feed utilisation compared to animals fed fresh macroalgae. The results of the current study suggest that the use of fresh G. cliftonii as a source of carbohydrates may spare protein when feeding formulated diets to abalone. When formulated diets are unavailable or are inappropriate to feed abalone, a mix of enriched Ulva sp. and G. cliftonii may be used. However, feeding fresh macroalgae alone to cultured greenlip abalone should be avoided, if growth is the parameter of interest and we recommend that commercial formulated diets be fed to cultured greenlip abalone.

We used multiple-choice feeding assays to ascertain the relative feeding preferences of four subtidal grazers (the amphipod Aora typica, the isopod Batedotea elongata and the gastropods Cookia sulcata and Haliotis iris) for the invasive macroalga Undaria pinnatifida and six native macroalgae (Macrocystis pyrifera, Durvillaea antarctica, Carpophyllum flexuosum, Cystophora scalaris, Marginariella boryana and Ulva spp.) that are all abundant along the Otago coast of southern New Zealand. Multiple-choice feeding assays were run under laboratory conditions during the austral autumn (April and June) of 2013. The relative abundances of the macroalgae in the field were also determined. All of the grazers ate U. pinnatifida at rates comparable to most of the native macroalgae, except for B. elongata, which barely consumed it. This indicates that U. pinnatifida, which was shown to be more abundant than native macroalgae in subtidal habitats, has the potential to contribute organic matter to the local food web and may be an undesirable food for some group of grazers. We suggest that U. pinnatifida could potentially alter existing trophic relationships. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948578533

Abalone artificial diets generally include fishmeal, limiting their utilization in ecologically sustainable aquaculture and affecting abalone quality and acceptance by the consumers. A six month feeding trial was conducted to assess the nutritional value of four different dried seaweed meals: Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta), Gracilaria cornea (Rhodophyta), Laminaria digitata (Phaeophyta) and Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), as ingredients to all-vegetable-based formulated feeds for abalone Haliotis tuberculata coccinea (33.1. ±. 0.8. mm and 4.7. ±. 0.6. g). A mixed fresh algae diet of G. cornea and U. Ulva rigida, reared in an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system, served as control. Survival rates were very high (95-98%), regardless of the diet fed. Enriched fresh algae produced a significantly higher growth for H. tuberculata coccinea (169% weight gain) than all the artificial diets (49-84% WG). Comparison among abalone fed the different formulated diets showed that the inclusion of P. palmata improved growth, condition index and dietary protein utilization. On the contrary, the use of L. digitata markedly reduced the efficiency of dietary protein since the protein-related nutritional index (PER), the percentage of protein deposited in the foot muscle as well as the meat to shell ratio recorded for animals fed this diet were the lowest, despite a higher feed intake. Large differences were found in the FA profile of fresh algae as compared with the three formulated diets. The n-3/n-6 ratio was much higher in the fresh algae and, consequently, in the foot tissues of abalone fed this diet in comparison to the one of those fed the formulated ones. The elevated contents of 20:4n-6 in the abalone fed the experimental diets and 20:5n-3 in abalone fed the fresh algae, as well as their respective metabolites, suggest that abalone have the ability to desaturate and elongate LA to ARA and ALA to EPA. Further studies are required to improve the growth obtained with these vegetable based diets, especially concerning the use of different seaweed combinations and inclusion levels, as well as the diet processing methods to improve diet water stability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934948490

Less attention has been given to the resulting quality of the seafood product from formulated feeds and the effect of the reduction of marine ingredients in these feeds. Marine n-3 fatty acids are particularly important nutritional factors of seafood that are lacking from feed ingredients at the base of the aquaculture production chain. Considering that this important category of nutrients is already deficient in the western diet, further erosion through cultivated seafood products is of concern. This study tested the effect of three diet categories on the fatty acid profiles of commercially farmed abalone. Two commercial formulated feeds, Ulva spp. macroalgae, and combinations of the formulated feeds and macroalgae were fed to six replicate baskets of 20 abalone (~62 mm) for 12 months in Victoria, Australia. The macroalgae diets represented overall lower fatty acid content, including eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA), but higher relative amounts of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), than the formulated feeds. The total lipid content of abalone tissue did not vary substantially across diet categories; however, the ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids decreased incrementally with the increasing macroalgae content in the diet and by a factor of two with a 100 % macroalgae diet. Also, equal or higher content of all important long chain n-3 fatty acids was achieved with a macroalgae diet despite the lower dietary content of some of these fatty acids. Marine fatty acid-deplete aquaculture feeds can result in decreased n-3 fatty acid content in the abalone tissue. The inclusion of macroalgae in the diet of abalone can offset this reduction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942551980

Probiotics have been proven to be positive promoters of aquatic animal growth, survival and health. In aquaculture, intestines, gills, the skin mucus of aquatic animals, and habitats or even culture collections and commercial products, can be sources for acquiring appropriate probiotics, which have been identified as bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and nonbacteria (bacteriophages, microalgae and yeasts). While a bacterium is a pathogen to one aquatic animal, it can bring benefits to another fish species; a screening process plays a significant role in making a probiotic species specific. The administration of probiotics varies from oral/water routine to feed additives, of which the latter is commonly used in aquaculture. Probiotic applications can be either mono or multiple strains, or even in combination with prebiotic, immunostimulants such as synbiotics and synbiotism, and in live or dead forms. Encapsulating probiotics with live feed is a suitable approach to convey probiotics to aquatic animals. Dosage and duration of time are significant factors in providing desired results. Several modes of actions of probiotics are presented, while some others are not fully understood. Suggestions for further studies on the effects of probiotics in aquaculture are proposed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942191805

Understanding the nocturnal feeding patterns of abalone is fundamental to feed management and productive abalone farming. In this study, the apparent feed consumption for greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) and hybrid abalone (H. laevigata3Haliotis rubra) fed fresh Ulva sp. or a commercial formulated diet at 18°C or 22°C were investigated at night. Abalone were exposed to low light intensity (3.4 Lux) from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM and darkness from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM. Abalone were fed to excess daily at 4:00 PM and feed intake was determined at 7:00 PM, 10:00 PM, 1:00 AM, 4:00 AM, and 8:00 AM. When Ulva sp. was added to the tank, greenlip and hybrid abalone immediately displayed a feeding response, which was not observed in abalone fed the formulated diet. Abalone consumed Ulva sp. at a linear rate from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM. In contrast, the apparent feed consumption rate of abalone fed the formulated diet was minimal from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, and was highest between 7:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Apparent feed consumption rate of abalone significantly increased as water temperature increased from 18°C to 22°C, but the effect was greater for hybrid abalone compared with greenlip abalone. The total apparent feed intake of both greenlip and hybrid abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly greater than for both types of abalone fed the formulated diet. The total apparent feed intake on dry basis, and nutrient intake for abalone fed Ulva sp. was significantly lower than for abalone fed the formulated diet. This study indicates that the upper temperature range for feed intake in hybrid abalone is higher than in greenlip abalone. Ulva sp. can stimulate abalone feeding, though the high moisture content in algae can reduce nutrient intake. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954174464

In both cases, mixed-species of red algae produced better growth in shell length and weight. This may be because abalone in the wild rarely feed on single species and they frequently encounter a variety of drift algae. It may also be due to the fact that nutrients lacking in single-species diets may be provided and/or fortified using a variety of seaweeds, which are locally abundant.

Concerns over the long-term supply of macroalgae have led farmers to investigate the suitability of various formulated feeds, however there has been limited commercial adoption. Combination diets of macroalgal and formulated feed fed together provide a mechanism to explore and adapt to formulated feed use without entirely abandoning macroalgal feed. The current study evaluated the use of formulated, macroalgal and two combination diets (low and high macroalgal supplementation) on production indicators and canning yields of juvenile abalone H. rufescens in a culture system modified for formulated feed. The macroalgal diet and the high macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (76.1% macroalgae: 23.9% pelleted diet as dry weight) produced significantly higher growth indicators (SGR and LGR) than the low macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (31.6% macroalgae: 68.4% pelleted diet as dry weight) and the formulated pellet diet. The protein efficiency ratio of the experimental treatments was positively related to the proportional contribution of fresh macroalgae in the diet. Furthermore, calculation of the protein efficiency ratio of the formulated component in combination diets (PER. f) revealed a significant positive relationship between macroalgae contribution and PER. f. This suggests that the increase in total PER is driven by the increased utilisation of protein in the formulated component of combination diets associated with increasing levels of fresh macroalgal supplementation. We suggest possible reasons why the presence of seaweed increased the availability of the formulated feed protein to the abalone. A simulated canning trial highlighted a significant positive linear relationship between meat canning yield and the proportional contribution of formulated feed. This study highlights the value of combination diets as a tool for abalone producers to harness the potential production advantages of macroalgae while still accessing the processing benefits associated with nutrient dense formulated feed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934894997

Here we investigated the feeding behaviour of juvenile greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata; fed live macroalgae and formulated diets at different rations; and observed their feeding behaviour using a novel ventral video monitoring technique. Four different diets (commercial chip, experimental flake, Ulva sp. and Gracilaria cliftonii) at two feeding rations (excess vs. restricted) were tested. Diet type had no effect on abalone movement, but macroalgal diets resulted in higher feed intakes. Restricting feed rations induced greater movement. Abalone moved little during the light period and moved mostly during darkness, except for animals on the restricted feed ration where feeding commenced during the light period. On farms, this phenomenon may be a useful behavioural indicator for identifying underfed abalone. Despite their lower intake, formulated diets promoted higher energy and nutritional intake, indicating that quantity of feed consumed is not solely indicative of nutritional gain.

We selected the following bioassays: the algal growth inhibition test (Skeletonema marinoi and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), the microcrustacean immobilization test (Artemia salina and Daphnia magna), development and adult survival tests on Hydra attenuata, embryotoxicity and metamorphosis tests on Crassostrea gigas, and in vitro assays on primary cultures of Haliotis tuberculata hemocytes. The results showed high inter-species variability in EC<inf>50</inf>-values ranging from 43 to 15,600 µg/L for fluoxetine, from 67 to 4,400 µg/L for sertraline, and from 4.70 µg/L to more than 100,000 µg/L for clomipramine. Algae (S. marinoi and P. subcapitata) and the embryo–larval stages of the oyster C. gigas were the most sensitive taxa. This raises an issue due to their ecological and/or economic importance.

As this issue is most relevant to farm production, we aimed to demonstrate that different mortality patterns are evident for 2- and 3-year-old greenlip abalone ( Haliotis laevigata Donovan), irrespective of reproductive state, and to provide potential, practical solutions to this issue. Growth rate, feed intake and haemolymph variables were measured.

Limitations on the availability and use of fish meal through EU directives (EC Regulation 999/2001 & EC Regulation 183/2005) are focussing research efforts to find alternative sources of protein for aquaculture feeds. Marine algae, although low in protein, are widely being considered as a potential alternative to fish meal as not only do they have the potential to impart additional health benefits when ingested but they can also be cultured under enrichment conditions to enhance their nutritional profile as a feed additive. For abalone (a marine gastropod mollusc), several studies have highlighted the benefits of a diet of fresh mixed species seaweed for cultivation. However, the performance of a mixed species marine algae meal, consisting of Laminaria digitata meal, Palmaria palmata meal and Ulva lactuca meal, in a formulated diet for abalone has not apparently been investigated. In this study, the performance of five novel, isonitrogenous, konjac glucomannan-xanthan gum (KX) bound feeds for the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were evaluated in a 12-week experimental growth trial. Comparisons were made between a basal diet formulation (Diet A), a basal diet. +. lipids. +. choline chloride (Diet B) and diets containing mixed seaweed meal (Diet C) or fish meal (Diet D) or mixed seaweed meal. +. fish meal (Diet E). Freshly harvested L. digitata was included as a natural feed type and experimental control. Dry matter leaching was assessed and no significant differences in the dry matter loss over 3 and 4. days were observed between the experimental KX feeds, although L. digitata was a significantly more seawater stable feed type. Daily food consumption (DFC) of Diet C and Diet E was significantly lower than that of fresh L. digitata and the DFC of Diet D was significantly higher than that of L. digitata. Diet E had significantly higher food conversion efficiency than L. digitata, Diet A, Diet B and Diet D. There was no difference in the protein efficiency ratio (PER) between the formulated diets but the PER of Diet D was significantly different to L. digitata. L. digitata had significantly higher linear growth rates than Diet B, and significant differences in the specific growth rates were observed between Diet A and Diet D only. No significant differences in body weight to shell length ratios and percentage survival between treatments were observed.

Overfishing not only affects the targeted species, but also potentially influences the integrity and functioning of the ecosystem through associated changes in community composition. We assessed the herbivorous effects of H. midae on the benthos through a 6-month field experiment involving exclusion/inclusion plots. This showed that benthic community composition remained largely unchanged whether H. midae was present or absent and specifically revealed no evidence that H. midae diminishes algal biomass, probably because in the region where we worked, it feeds mainly by trapping drift kelp rather than grazing on attached algae. The absence of responses to the removal of abalone was additionally evident in comparison with indices of abundance and diversity, functional groups and individual species. In the absence of abalone, there were subtle increases in the green alga Codium stephensiae and the crustose brown alga Zeacarpa leiomorpha and decreases in the four species of foliose macroalgae, but none of these effects were significant. The presence of H. midae thus had no negative grazing effects on any elements of the epilithic community composition.

The results confirmed high uptake efficiency during the entire year, equivalent to a 100% removal of the NH<inf>4</inf>, NO<inf>3</inf>, and PO<inf>4</inf> produced by the land-based abalone culture. The growth rate and productivity of U. lactuca presented a marked seasonality, increasing from fall until summer and varying from 0.5 ± 0.2% to 2.6 ± 0.2% d-1 and 10 ± 6.1% to 73.6 ± 8.4% g m-2 d-1 for sustainable growth rate and productivity, respectively. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence that demonstrates the high possibility of changing the traditional monoculture system of abalone in Chile, to a sustainable integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system, generating positive environmental externalities, including the use of U. lactuca as a biofiltration unit. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906903407

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of four different macroalgae (Gracilaria tenuistipitata, Laminaria japonica, Gelidium japonica, and Sargassum sp.) on the feed intake and feeding rate of juvenile Haliotis asinina Linnaeus (H asinina), and the effect of these macroalgae on abalone food choice as single or combined diets. Juveniles of H. asinina with mean initial weight and shell length of 5.2 ± 0.9 g and 24.2 ± 0.7 mm, respectively, were selected, and the experiments lasted for approximately 100 days. In trial 1, there were four treatments, and each supplied with a single macroalgal species with 24 h fasting; in trial 2, all four macroalgal species were supplied together with 24 h fasting; in trial 3, the juveniles were fasted for an additional 24 h before supplying a single diet to explore the effect of the fasting; and in trial 4, different combinations of macroalgae were supplied as diet for biological evaluation of factors, including daily rate of shell increase, weight growth rate, specific growth rate, and feed conversion efficiency. Comparison of different feed intakes, feeding rates, and selection rates suggested that H. asinina juveniles showed different feeding preferences for the different macroalgae. The most consumed diet was G. japonica (red algae), followed by G. tenuistipitata (red algae), and L. japonica (brown algae), and finally, Sargassum sp. (brown algae). The results of trial 4 suggested that mixed feeds had better effects than single diets (P<0.05), and the best diet combination was L. japonica and G. tenuistipitata. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903815866

The major habitat of the abalones is the rocky shore with kelp forests >50 m depth. The major food source for the South African abalone Haliotis midae is brown algae, i.e., Ecklonia maxima. It is interesting that most of the nonflagellated vibrios are found in the gut of abalones. Species-specific detection methods are available for V. halioticoli, V. neonatus, and V. ezurae. In situ PCR specific to an alginate lyase gene of V. halioticoli was capable of discriminating between V. halioticoli and related vibrios. The best system for settlement and growth involved use of trail mucus plus diatoms. This led to 97.3% settlement and 70% survival during the 4 weeks of the experiment. Finally, it was apparent that the abalone larvae normally grew up to 1.4 mm in length. Host abalones start ingesting seaweed, preferring brown algae, and this is accompanied by development of the host digestive system. It is reasoned that sustainable nutrient supplies for V. halioticoli and/or other gut microbes lead to stable microbial ecosystem in the gut of abalones. The nonmotile vibrios could then be available for future entry into and colonization of the abalone gut. Volatile short-chained fatty acids (VSCFAs) are available to the host animal as fermentation products converted from energy-rich carbohydrates. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-105007961633

This study examined the dietary effects of P yezoensis versus the kelps Saccharinajaponica and Saccharina ochotensis on the growth of juvenile sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus intermedius) and abalones (Haliotis discus hannai). Urchins fed P. yezoensis had significantly higher food conversion efficiency (42.0%) and digestibility (94.9%) compared to urchins fed S. japonica. For abalone, the conversion efficiency of P yezoensis was 14.0%. No significant differences in growth rates were detected between the urchins and abalones fed P yezoensis and kelp. These results suggest that the high concentration of protein in P yezoensis contributed to the high food conversion efficiencies ofjuvenile sea urchins and abalones and the high digestibility found in sea urchins. However, it is likely that the thin thalli of P yezoensis made them difficult to graze efficiently.

In the Philippines, the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center has successfully produced Haliotis asinina seeds in the hatchery. Aside from utilizing these seeds in aquaculture, they are also being considered for future stock enhancement endeavors of the department. This study aimed to evaluate post release behavior, recapture and growth rates of hatchery-reared abalone juveniles released in the Sagay Marine Reserve. From the two release trials conducted, results showed that abalone of shell length >3.0 cm had lower mortality during onsite acclimation and utilized transport modules as temporary shelter for a shorter period after release. Both wild and hatchery-reared abalone preferred dead branching corals with encrusting algae as their habitat. Recapture rates were comparable between the wild (7.97%) and hatchery-reared (HR2) abalone (6.47%). Monthly growth rates were almost the same between wild (0.25 cm, 4.0 g), hatchery-reared (HR1: 0.27 cm, 4.6 g; HR2: 0.35 cm, 3.8 g) abalone. Moreover, hatchery-reared abalone were recaptured up to 513 days post-release, indicating viability of released stocks in the wild.

Various studies have suggested that this urchin outcompetes black-lipped abalone (Haliotis rubra) for resources, but experiments elucidating the mechanisms are lacking.Methodology/Principal Findings:We outline a new framework involving experimental manipulations and Markov chain and Pareto modelling to examine the effects of interspecific competition between urchins and abalone and the effect of intraspecific competition in abalone, assessed as effects on behaviour. Manipulations of abalone densities had no detectable effect on urchin behavioural transitions, movement patterns or resightability through time. In contrast, additions of urchins resulted in abalone shifting microhabitats from exposed to sheltered positions, an increase in the proportion of mobile abalone, and declines in abalone resightability through time relative to controls without the urchins. Our results support the hypothesis of asymmetrical competitive interactions between urchins and abalone.Conclusions/Significance:The introduction of urchins to intact algal beds causes abalone to flee and seek shelter in cryptic microhabitat which will negatively impact both their accessibility to such microhabitats, and productivity of the abalone fishery, and will potentially affect their growth and survival, while the presence of the abalone has no detectable effect on the urchin.

However, the intensity of predation can vary dramatically among habitats. The habitat can directly affect the interaction between predator and prey; but also, by determining the distributions of predators and prey, the habitat can mediate the likelihood of a predatory encounter. Here, we used laboratory experiments to identify the likely predators of juvenile abalone Haliotis iris on temperate reefs in central New Zealand. Predator performance in the laboratory was assessed in conditions without prey refuge, in simulated juvenile habitat as well as in the presence of alternate prey. We then used surveys to compare the abundance of predators and juvenile abalone to explore if negative associations between predator and prey in the laboratory manifest in the field. Last, we manipulated algal habitat complexity at 2 depths and quantified the effect of predator exclusion on juvenile abalone survival in the field. We found that starfish were the likely predators of juvenile H. iris in our study system. Furthermore, predation of juvenile abalone by starfish was lowest in habitats with the greatest structural complexity, and there is evidence that predation by starfish in cobble habitats was size-dependent. Overall, we found that habitat variability mediates predation on juvenile abalone by determining the likelihood of an encounter between predator and prey. © Inter-Research 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881069383

The use of cultivated macroalgae in place of such feeds could provide for better environmental, nutritional and/or economic outcomes for this industry. However, direct comparison trials using macroalgae and formulated crop feeds are rare, and it is therefore difficult to ascertain the benefits and costs of each feed type. This study compares the benefits to growth and performance of the cultivated hybrid abalone cross (Haliotis rubra 1814 Leach and Haliotis laevigata 1808 Donovan) which was fed one of eight dietary treatments, including two commercially formulated pellet feeds and six mixed macroalgae dietary treatments. Macroalgae dietary treatments comprised the three macroalgae species Grateloupia turuturu Yamada, Ulva australis Areschoug and/or Ulva laetevirens Areschoug. Four replicate tubs, each containing 40 juvenile abalone (10-15 mm), were used to test each dietary treatment over a 12-week period. Macroalgae dietary treatments provided for significantly higher specific growth rates of abalone compared to formulated feeds, by orders of magnitude, for both length (>0.2 % compared to <0.1 % day-1, F <inf>7, 31</inf> = 22.3, p < 0.0001) and weight (from <0.4 to >0.8 % day-1, F <inf>7, 31</inf> = 24.4, p < 0.0001). In addition, abalone health and condition increased, and the proximate composition of abalone tissue had a higher carbohydrate/protein ratio, higher ash content and lower lipid content. These findings suggest that the juvenile abalone may benefit from macroalgae diets in comparison to two formulated feeds as a result of optimal proximate composition of the algae biomass and improved condition of the abalone. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877626339

Both Cu and Zn were effectively accumulated by the abalones from water or macroalgae, but their concentration factors and trophic transfer factors were low due to the regulation of Cu and Zn accumulation. Following waterborne or dietary exposure, the abalones exhibited different accumulation patterns of Cu and Zn. The tissue Zn burden decreased quickly after the initial accumulation, and the incoming Zn was mainly deposited in the viscera. In contrast, the tissue Cu burden increased rapidly and gradually reached a steady state. The abalone muscle exhibited a comparable storage capacity of Cu as the viscera and the accumulated Cu in muscle was mainly derived from the dissolved phase instead of trophic transfer.

We investigated the relationship between abalone resources and quantitative or qualitative changes of algal beds in coastal waters around the Ojika Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture, southwestern Japan, from 1988 to 2011. During this period, the catch record of 2 abalone species-Haliotis discus discus and Haliotis gigantea-was examined, and the composition and abundance of macroalgae around the Ojika Islands was observed. The annual landing of abalone has decreased steadily from 91 mt in 1987 to 0.4 mt in 2011. The proportion of H. discus discus to the annual abalone landing has also changed; it was stable (30%-60%) between 1988 and 2000, less than 20% from 2004 to 2005, and increased from 2006, reaching more than 90% in 2010. The macroalgal beds have also changed during this period. The perennial Laminariales beds, consisting of Eisenia bicyclis and Ecklonia spp., had disappeared by 2003, shifting mostly to Sargassaceae (Sargassum macrocarpum) beds. After the Sargassaceae beds had disappeared by 2009, there have been no Laminariales or Sargassaceae beds except for spring algal beds (unusual perennial Sargassaceae beds that form dense stands from March to July and lose most thalli after maturing in August) in some fishing ports. The results suggest a differential detrimental effect of the disappearance of macroalgal beds on abalone, with different species having different effects. After 2009, when no perennial Laminariales or Sargassaceae beds were present, there were no mature individuals of H. gigantea, with no recruitment at the juvenile stage of the latter at major fishing grounds. Reformation of the macroalgal beds is indispensable to sustain or restore the H. gigantea population. On the other hand, because most H. discus discus are able to mature, they can sustain a viable population under this condition. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877271465

Larvae and early juveniles were fed daily with diatoms, whereas late juveniles and adults were fed with artificial food and the green algae Ulva fasciata. Shell length and total wet weight from 40-80 randomly selected specimens in various experiments were measured monthly, and sex and gonad maturity stage were defined visually. The water parameters in tanks reflected the ambient condition of the Arabian Sea. The growth pattern of the abalone was very similar in the 3 experimental trials. Larvae and early juveniles have very fast growth rates, reaching an average 53-56 mm and 19-25 g after 1 y. Better results were obtained in the second and third experiments, when at the end of 2 y of rearing, abalone mean length was 67-72 mm and the weight was 46-54 g. At the age 3 y, abalone attained a mean length of 83-85 mm and a weight of 89-93 g. After 6 y, the abalone from the first experiment (2001 to 2005) showed, on average, 88.5 mm and 110.9 g. The length increments were the highest during the first year of the culture, whereas weight increments reached maximum values during the third (second and third trials) and fourth year (first trial) of rearing. After 4 y, abalone growth increments in weight decreased significantly. Males generally but not always have larger increments in length and weight when compared with females. During cultivation, a decrease in abalone weight was sometimes observed that, in most cases, coincided with decrease in water temperature during the southwest monsoon period (June to September). Some abalone sexually matured in tanks after 1 y, and mature males and females occurred almost year-round, with peaks in April to May and November to December. The length at first maturity was found to be 65.2 mm for males and 67.1 mm for females. Growth parameters for a von Bertalanffy function were calculated using data from different experiments. The growth rate coefficient in the first experiment was lower (K = 0.65), but in third experiment it appeared higher (K = 0.80) than in natural conditions from data other authors calculated based on length-frequency distribution analysis, which indicates faster growth rates of abalone in tanks when compared with those in the wild. Results of the trials showed that it is feasible to produce Omani abalone in land-based farms from eggs to commercial size during a 3 4-y cycle. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877259725

The current study quantified the protein contents of Ulva rigida and Ulva capensis from natural populations and Ulva lactuca from a commercial, integrated seaweed/abalone aquaculture system. Three methods of protein quantification were used: the Bradford method, crude protein, and specific nitrogen to protein (N-Prot) conversion factors, and results were compared to each other. The results showed that values obtained with the ""traditional"" conversion factor of 6. 25 were on average higher than Bradford values by factors of 64. 1 % in U. capensis, 77. 1 % in U. rigida and 58. 9 % in U. lactuca. This pattern is in line with other published work on seaweed and microalgae. Analyses of amino acid composition showed that aspartic acid was the most abundant amino acid and that these species were also rich in glycine and alanine but poor in histidine, methionine and cysteine. N-Prot factors were as follows: U. capensis, 5. 58; U. rigida, 5. 12 and U. lactuca, 5. 65.

At multiple locations, we examined the hypothesis that diversity and abundance in temperate reef fish assemblages were independent of bait type. We used 3 bait types (abalone viscera, pilchards and crushed urchin) and quantified commonly used metrics for the fish assemblage, including species richness, time of first arrival and relative abundance on 3 shallow rocky reefs in southeastern Australia over 2 yr. We distinguished the following 6 feeding guilds: herbivore, zooplanktivore, alga/invertebrate consumers, invertebrate carnivore, macroinvertebrate carnivore and generalist carnivore. The response of fishes was dependent on bait type, with urchin bait performing particularly poorly. Although we did not detect statistical differences between the performance of pilchards and abalone viscera as bait, pilchards produced more consistent outcomes. Importantly, we also observed strong spatial effects. In general, bait type had a marked effect on species richness, but little influence on relative abundance. Overall we conclude that oily bait such as pilchards, which have been widely used in most studies, yield the most consistent outcomes. Consequently, bait type and spatial variation in fish assemblages needs to be considered in sampling designs to assess the limitations of BRUVS.

Irradiance and temperature were the most important factors affecting gametophyte development. Meiospores harvested in spring exhibited maximum reproductive and growth potential, while spores released during autumn were moribund, and died within a few days.

Larval settlement was the highest on CCA (61 %) tailed by a 45-day-old mix of U. lens and U. rigida (52%) and 45-day-old U. rigida (46%). Settlement was the lowest (about 3%) on a mix of 4-day-old U. lens and U. rigida and 45-day-old enriched or unenriched U. lens.

This not only affects the species itself but potentially the functioning of the ecosystem because of associated changes in community structure. The nature of effects that can follow the loss or reduction of a species depends in part on its position in the foodweb and its feeding behaviour. To assess the ecosystem effects of the adults and subadults of this previously abundant herbivore on the south-west coast of South Africa, we studied their diet and mode of food procurement by (a) in-field observations of adult and subadult abalone, (b) analysis of the gut contents of adults, (c) comparison of diet with the availability of algae, and (d) a mesocosm experiment on subadult feeding behaviour. Both field and dietary studies showed that adults subsist mainly by trapping drift kelp, but also occasionally graze on attached algae such as Plocamium spp., and feed in a manner that is highly selective, with drift kelp constituting 95-98% of the diet, and several species of common algae being avoided. In the mesocosm experiment, subadults preferentially fed on drift kelp, but emerged at night to a greater extent to graze on microflora if no drift material was available. Their propensity to emerge was, however, reduced if the rock lobster Jasus lalandii was present. Collectively, this evidence indicates that any ecosystem effects that subadults and adults of H. midae have as grazers will be weak because they feed mainly by trapping drift material, and the frequency of grazing and the incidence of consumption of attached algae are low. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865203680

Here we found that the tropical H. asinina had strong and consistent preferences for the red alga Hypnea pannosa and the green alga Ulva flexuosa, but no overarching relationship between protein content (sum of amino acids) and preference existed. For example, preferred Hypnea and Ulva had distinctly different protein contents (12.64 vs. 2.99 g 100 g-1) and the protein-rich Asparagopsis taxiformis (>15 g 100 g-1 of dry weight) was one of the least preferred algae. The limiting amino acid in all algae was methionine, followed by histidine or lysine. Furthermore we demonstrated that preferences can largely be removed using carrageenan as a binder for dried alga, most likely acting as a feeding attractant or stimulant. The apparent decoupling between feeding preference and algal nutritive values may be due to a trade off between nutritive values and grazing deterrence associated with physical and chemical properties. © 2012 Angell et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862240438

Recently, prominent blooms of Cochlodinium have occurred in central and southern California (2004-2008), and Cochlodinium cells are now routinely observed in microscopical analysis of algal assemblages from Californian coastal waters. The first documented economic loss due to a Cochlodinium bloom in California occurred in Monterey Bay and resulted in the mortality of commercially farmed abalone. Increasing occurrences of Cochlodinium blooms, the fact that these cells preserve poorly using standard techniques, and the difficulty of identifying preserved specimens using morphological criteria make Cochlodinium species prime candidates for the development of a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach. The 18S rDNA gene sequenced from Cochlodinium cells obtained from California coastal waters, as well as GenBank sequences of Cochlodinium, were used to design and test a Molecular Beacon ® approach. The qPCR method developed in this study is species specific, sensitive for the detection of C. fulvescens that has given rise to the recent blooms in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and spans a dynamic abundance range of seven orders of magnitude. Initial application of the method to archived field samples collected during blooms in Monterey Bay revealed no statistically significant correlations between gene copy number and environmental parameters. However, the onset of Cochlodinium blooms in central California was consistent with previously reported findings of correlations to decreased surface temperature and increased inputs of nitrogenous nutrients. © 2012 Phycological Society of America. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859423168

Larvae were settled on Ulvella lens and Ulva rigida germlings at a density of 0.5larvaecm2 of substrate. Growth and survival, in each dietary treatment, were monitored during ten weeks. Experimental nursery tanks were weekly inoculated with 2L of the different diatom inoculums (105-106cellsmL-1). Proximate biochemical compositions were significantly different for the four diatom species. Amphora sp. presented a significantly higher lipid and protein contents with 7.11±0.29% DW and 18.50±0.97% DW respectively, while Proschkinia sp. presented the lowest protein content and the highest ash content. The fatty acid profiles of the diatoms were variable but remained typical of the diatom family. Larvae contained significantly more lipids (25.30±0.93% DW) than juveniles. The different fatty acid compositions found for the various diatom species were dissimilar to the ones of larvae, juveniles and substrates; (Courtois de Viçose et al., in press-a) the fatty acid compositions of these last two not being different among treatments. 16:4n-3, 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid, ARA) and 22:5n-3 (docosapentaenoic acid, DPA) were the most abundant fatty acids in juveniles while 20:5n-3 (ecosapentaenoic acid, EPA) was the dominant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), present at a comparable level in all diatoms. This suggests that the post-larvae and juveniles are capable to absorb a selection of fatty acids from the food source or that they are able to synthesise them from precursor dietary fatty acids. Growth rates obtained in the present study are presenting different phases and diatom diets made little difference to growth rate of post-larvae until reaching around 0.8-1mmSL, after which divergence in growth rate among diets became significant. Post-larvae fed the diatom with the highest protein and lipid contents (Amphora sp.) showed the best daily growth rate (DGR) of 50±3μm over the feeding trial, highlighting the joint influence of diatoms' protein and lipid content on growth. Around 2mmSL, juveniles exhibited increased growth rates, in all treatments, reaching 94μmday-1, indicating a possible shift in nutrition towards green macroalgae germlings and suggesting that U. lens and U. rigida are used as a complement to the diatom diet at this stage. 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 found in high amount in all juveniles as well as in all substrates could be an indication of that nutritional shift and could be involved in growth enhancement. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857108990

Nine of the diets were prepared specifically for urchins and varied in protein (16-40% protein) and carbohydrate (29-49% carbohydrate) levels. The other two diets consisted of a commercially available abalone diet and the kelp, Saccharina latissima. Weight measurements were carried out at 6-wk intervals, and at the end of the study urchins were individually weighed and a subsample from each treatment was analyzed for gonad weight and color. End weights after 6 mo ranged from 2.56 g for urchins fed the abalone diet to 6.11 g for urchins fed one of the prepared diets.

This study used three approaches to test whether overharvesting of blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) can cause a shift in benthic habitat to a configuration that is unsuitable for abalone, on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia. After 18 months of removing abalone from rocks, encrusting red algae (ERA) became overgrown by filamentous and foliose algae, sessile invertebrates and accumulated sediment. The differences in the community composition between locations, sites nested within locations and rocks were minor. Throughout the study, abalone were largely associated with areas of rock covered in ERA but avoided other habitats. A transplant experiment demonstrated that abalone preferred areas of rock covered in ERA but move away from overgrown rocks. These results suggest overharvesting of abalone results in a shift to benthic habitat poorly preferred by abalone.

Fish used for aquaculture include nonpearl oysters, mussels, yabbies, marron, crayfish, abalone, prawns, freshwater and marine finfish, trochus and algae for beta carotene (ie any marine organism other than reptiles, birds and mammals). Global wild fisheries are in decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish, such as fish meal and fish oil. Studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon, as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them. Apart from fish and shrimp, some aquaculture undertakings, such as seaweed and filterfeeding bivalve mollusks like oysters, clams, mussels and scallops, are relatively benign and even environmentally restorative. Filter-feeders filter pollutants as well as nutrients from the water, improving water quality. Some profitable aquaculture cooperatives promote sustainable practices. New methods lessen the risk of biological and chemical pollution through minimizing fish stress, fallowing netpens, and applying Integrated Pest Management. Vaccines are being used more and more to reduce antibiotic use for disease control. Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using polyculture techniques, and properly sited facilities (e.g. offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857403140

Commercial abalone nurseries typically settle larvae onto vertical plastic plates coated with algae that act as a settlement cue and an important post-settlement food source. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate algal food supply as the abalones grow and for this purpose many nurseries use the alga, Ulvella lens, as it is a very effective settlement cue as well as offering a resilient food source for the developing abalones. However, juvenile abalones can deplete a film of diatoms on the plates before they are capable of ingesting U. lens, and once abalone reach ~. 5. mm SL the high grazing pressure may exceed even what U. lens can support, requiring nurseries to provide additional cultured algae or prematurely wean the juveniles onto manufactured diets. Three prospective microfilamentous algal species isolated from the tanks of a commercial abalone facility, were selected as potentially suitable nursery algae as they demonstrated resistance to intensive juvenile grazing pressure, displayed rapid vegetative growth, and could be triggered to mass sporulate as a means of rapidly coating nursery tanks. The current study involved two experiments and assessed the suitability of each species as a live algal feed for juvenile abalones compared to U. lens. These experiments measured: (1) ingestibility and grazing resistance of each alga against juvenile abalone 1-8. mm SL, and (2) the ability of each species to recover once grazers had been removed. Two algae (Ulvophyceae sp. 1 and 3) demonstrated the desirable properties of being easily grazed by abalones of a smaller size (average SL 2.33. mm and 2.20. mm respectively) than U. lens (2.89. mm) yet provide an algal film that is likely to be resilient and durable under grazing pressure. These algae also displayed significantly greater rates of recovery following grazing than U. lens (p < 0.01), an important attribute for restoring algal films in nursery systems between grazing events or between batches of juvenile abalones. The results of this study indicate that these novel algae have a combination of desirable characteristics for use in commercial abalone nurseries. Further experiments in commercial scale nursery systems should be pursued to assess the food value and performance of these species as a feed for juvenile abalones. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052910087

This study examines the effect of macroalgae Ulva lactuca and Spyridia filamentosa, cyanobacteria Arthrospira maxima, and microalgae Dunaliella salina on the growth and immunity of Haliotis laevigata, in comparison to a commercially formulated pellet. Over 12 weeks, U. lactuca or S. filamentosa produced the lowest growth rate, indicating lack of nutrients for abalone growth in a single macroalgae diet. Pellets supplemented with 10% A. maxima or D. salina resulted in increased abalone shell length (13.3 and 30.7%, respectively) and body weight (19.9 and 33.4%) over the pellet control diet. The impact of algal supplementation on hemolymph immunity was mainly represented by a drop in total hemocyte counts (THC) and some diet specific effects on superoxide anion and antibacterial activity against Vibrio anguillarum. No effect of diet was observed on phagocytosis, phenoloxidase, or antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1. It is conceived that the humoral antimicrobial factors in abalone hemolymph are innately biosynthesized rather than dietary derived compounds. Nevertheless, concomitant with strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 in a lipophilic extract of U. lactuca and S. filamentosa, higher antiviral activity was detected in the digestive lipid extract of abalone fed U. lactuca (64.2% at 650 μg ml-1) or S. filamentosa (69.51%) compared to abalone fed pellets (47.42%) or pellets supplemented with A. maxima (46.3%) or D. salina (46%). This suggests that abalone may also derive some protection against oral pathogens by algal derived bioactive compounds. These results indicate that abalone growth rate could be optimized by A. maxima and D. salina supplementations, whereas U. lactuca and S. filamentosa could be useful supplements for abalone aquaculture, especially in areas with high risk of herpesvirus infection. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052889827

Research has focussed mainly on tropical coral reefs, but temperate reefs play a no less important ecological role in colder waters, where OA effects may first be manifest. Herein, we report that trends in pH at the surface of three ecologically important cold-water calcifiers (a primary producer and herbivores), under a range of fluid flows, differ substantially from one another, and for two of the three calcifiers, the pH, during darkness, is lower than the mean projected pH due to OA for the surface waters of the global ocean beyond the year 2100. Using micro-electrodes, we show that each calcifier had a different pH gradient between its surface and mainstream seawater, i.e. within the diffusion boundary layer (DBL) that appears to act as an environmental buffer to mainstream pH. Abalone encountered only mainstream seawater pH, whereas pH at the sea urchins' surface was reduced by ~0.35 units. For coralline algae, pH was ~0.5 units higher in the light and ~0.35 units lower under darkness than in ambient mainstream seawater. This wide range of pH within the DBL of some calcifiers will probably affect their performance under projected future reductions in pH due to OA. Differing exposure to a range of surface pH may result in differential susceptibility of calcifiers to OA. Such fluctuations are no doubt regulated by the interplay of water movement, morphology and metabolic rates (e.g. respiration, calcification and/or photosynthesis). Our study, by considering physics (flow regime), chemistry (pH gradients vs. OA future projections) and biology (trophic level, physiology and morphology), reveals that predicting species-specific responses and subsequent ecosystem restructuring to OA is complex and requires a holistic, eco-mechanical, approach. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052461194

Taking into account that sustainable, eco-friendly production methods are to be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry, growth performance of juvenile abalone reared in an integrated culture system was evaluated and compared with that of abalone fed non-enriched macroalgae. Four macroalgae treatments, three monospecific: Ulva rigida (UN), Hypnea spinella (HN) and Gracilaria cornea (GN) and a composite one (MN), were produced out of fishpond wastewater effluents, while other four control treatments consisted of the same species reared in fresh seawater (U; H; G; M). Seaweeds reared in fishpond wastewater effluents increased their protein content from 11-17% to 29-34%. Lipids consisted mainly of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (43-60%), palmitic acid being the most abundant fatty acid (40-47%). Highest EPA percentage was found in red algae H. spinella (6.9%), being ten times higher than that of U. rigida (0.7%). All the algae tested contained very low levels of arachinodic acid (0.1-1.6%) and docosahexaenoic acid (0.5-3%). Protein levels in foot muscle (74-76%) did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among treatments. Survival was generally high, ranging from 85 to 100%. Weight gain (17-561%) and SGR (0.2-2.3%) were positively related to protein content; whereas, protein efficiency ratio (PER) (0.5-3.7) was negative correlated. PE ratios increased by 82-159% (DW) as a function of the enrichment among the different diets. Food conversion ratio (FCR) (7-188) improved according to the increase in PER. Overall, biofilter-produced macroalgae showed a significantly higher dietary value compared to the control treatments. Similarly, animals fed the mixed diets performed significantly better than those fed a single algal diet.

The water diffusion coefficient of the pellets was determined using the equation of Fick's second law, which resulted in values between 0.84-1.94×10 -10 m 2/s. The drying kinetics was modeled using Page, Modified Page, Root of time, Exponential, Logarithmic, Two-Terms, Modified Henderson-Pabis and Weibull models.

Recruit density (<5 weeks post-settlement) was measured on cobbles covered with crustose coralline algae. Habitats of low complexity (barrens treatments) had consistently greater densities of recruits than habitats of high complexity (algae treatments). However, recruits in algae habitats were larger, and for deep habitats, there was greater survival in algae habitats compared with barrens habitats. While depth had no significant effect on early recruit (<2 weeks post-settlement) density, late recruit (<5 weeks post-settlement) density was greater in shallow habitats, and so it seems recruit survival was greater in shallow habitats.

Abalone larvae were exposed to the different biofilm treatments and controls (no biofilms) for seven (attachment and metamorphosis) and 14 (settlement and survival) days. The larvae performed significantly better in the dual microalgal biofilms compared to controls, and some biofilms resulted in better attachment, metamorphosis, settlement, and survival than others. For example, the best-performing biofilms almost always contained cyan obacteria (Oscillatoria cf. erythrata, Anacystis cf. aeruginosa, and Schizothrix cf. calcicola), which are attributed with better nutritional values. However, the amino acid profiles did not produce a clear pattern with regard to their effects on the four larval processes.

Here, we related the abalone diet during the grow-out phase to the sensory quality of the product as a function of abalone diet and the tasters' preference. A quantitative descriptive analysis of the flavour and texture of abalone raised on Ulva sp., kelp, a mixed diet of various macroalgae, and a formulated compound feed, as well as of wild-collected abalone, was undertaken. Raw and cooked samples of abalone meat from each of four feed categories (Ulva spp., kelp, manufactured pellets and mixed diets) and of wild-caught abalone were offered to a taste panel (comprising abalone farmers, abalone buyers and local consumers) which was asked to score each sample for 20 sensory attributes; the sensory attributes responsible for differentiating between the samples were then identified. Complex interactions among the sensory variables were identified as important drivers of the ability of panellists to distinguish between samples. For the raw samples, visual characteristics were particularly important. Conversely, taste became generally more important in the cooked samples. The experience of the tasters (e.g. producers, local consumers or buyers) also influenced how the panellists perceived the sensory quality, with the abalone buyers having a more discerning palate. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149447531

However, it also possesses a high ability to accumulate trace metals in its tissues. This study investigated the accumulation of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) in this macroalga under various temperatures and salinities, and the subsequent influences on growth rate, lipid peroxidation, and total energy reserve. The accumulation of both Cd and Cu was enhanced with increasing temperature and decreasing salinity. The bioaccumulation factor of Cu was ~10 times higher than that of Cd. Changes in temperature, salinity and accumulated metals all affected the tested biomarkers to some extent. We demonstrated that growth rate, lipid peroxidation level and total energy reserve were all significantly correlated with the accumulated tissue Cu concentrations, suggesting that Cu accumulation in the tissue can be used as a proxy for measuring Cu toxicity in G. tenuistipitata under various environmental conditions. In contrast, among the 3 toxic endpoints, only growth rate was inversely related to the Cd tissue concentrations. Cu exerted a greater toxic effect on G. tenuistipitata than Cd, largely due to its different toxicological mechanisms and biological accumulation potentials. Cd appeared to have no profound influence on the production of reactive oxygen species. A higher Cd accumulation at lower salinity did not cause a stronger growth inhibition as compared to Cu. Given the commercial value of the macroalga as a main food source in abalone aquaculture, Cu contamination and high temperature should be avoided in the culture of G. tenuistipitata, because they can reduce its energy reserves. © Inter-Research 2010. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649266426

In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (13C and 15N) were tested to detect nutritional sources during the early life stages of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai in laboratory experiments to evaluate stable isotope analyses as an appropriate investigative tool for field studies. Fertilized eggs, larvae, and the parent spawner muscle were analyzed to detect a nutritional source during the nonfeeding period. The 13C of fertilized eggs showed slight depletion, about 2‰, compared with that of the parent muscle, and was not detectable after lipid extraction of fertilized eggs. As for the larvae, the isotopic values in postlarvae after settlement and metamorphosis were 2‰ more enriched, become similar to that of the spawner muscle. These results imply that the lipid portion of the eggs is the primary nutritional source during the nonfeeding period of abalone. Laboratory feeding experiments were conducted during which early postlarval abalone (approximately 1 mm in shell length (SL)) were reared for 7 days and supplied with 4 benthic diatoms respectively. The benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium produced high growth and survival rates for early postlarval abalone, and there was a significant isotopic shift in their 13C, approaching that of C. closterium. Larger postlarval abalone (SL, >1.3 mm) were fed 1 of 5 benthic diatoms and a gametophyte of a macroalga, Undaria pinnatifida, for 21 days. Isotopic changes approaching the 13C of the provided benthic diatoms were detected from postlarvae fed the benthic diatoms Achnanthes longipes, Cocconeis scutellum, C. closterium, and the gametophyte of U. pinnatifida, which provided high survival rates and growth rates for the postlarvae. From these results, stable isotope ratios of postlarval abalone are suggested to be useful to infer the origin of the assimilated diets.

Most commercial abalone nurseries settle larvae onto vertical plastic plates coated in a film of algae that acts as a settlement cue and an important postsettlement food source. As abalone grow, their food consumption increases exponentially, and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain an adequate supply of algal food. Even grazing-resistant algae, like Ulvella lens, are often depleted when abalone reach 35 mm SL, requiring nurseries to provide additional algae or to wean the juveniles prematurely onto manufactured diets. Early weaning typically results in slower growth and higher mortality relative to live algal feeds. The current study tested various algal species to aid early weaning of the abalone Haliotis iris. Two experiments were conducted pairing nursery tanks of similar environmental conditions to test a total of three algal treatments: (1) the benthic diatom Nitzschia longissima, (2) a film of N. longissima and U. lens, and (3) a film of N. longissima and a naturally occurring mixture of green algal species that remained on weaning tank surfaces after a previous cohort of abalone had been harvested from the tank. Algae were established prior to the introduction of juvenile (SL, 27 mm) H. iris at a density of 15,00030,000 abalone per tank (2.5 m3 water volume, 13 m2 surface area). The abalone were raised to approximately 15 mm SL with twice-weekly supplementary feeding of suspended N. longissima during the first 4 wk, and the addition of manufactured feed 3 times a day for the duration of the experiment. The N. longissima films were completely removed by grazing within 45 days whereas the green algal films persisted for 60120 days. Despite the difference in resilience of algal films, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in abalone performance between treatments 1 (98.7% survival, growth of 85 m/day) and 2 (98.3% survival, growth of 92 m/day). In a second experiment, treatment 2 provided slightly greater growth than the mixed algal film of treatment 3(101 m/day vs. 96 m/day, P = 0.034), but survival rates were similar (98.2% vs. 98.3%, P = 0.86). All 3 algal treatments offer practical and effective means of weaning H. iris onto manufactured feeds at an SL of more than 3 mm. However, both treatments 1 and 3 can be established more rapidly than U. lens and are therefore likely to be more efficient for commercial weaning of H. iris and potentially for other species of abalone. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449281241

The nutritional value of four fouling macroalgae (Codium fragile, Sargassum muticum, Ulva pertusa and Laminaria japonica) and one cultured macroalgae (Gracilaria lemaneiformis) as the diet of abalone was assessed by analysis of the chemical composition of the macroalgae and by measuring bioavailability and digestibility to abalone H. discus hannai under laboratory conditions in August 2007. The results showed that the biomass of fouling macroalgae at the two sites was 243.61 ± 26.23 and 1078.15 ± 50.28 g m-1 respectively. The contents of protein of G. lemaneiformis and C. fragile were 18.30% and 17.60%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the others. The five macroalgae were accepted by the abalone, and growth energies (P) and growth efficiency (%) were positive. However, significant differences were found among the different macroalgae. The growth efficiencies of abalone show a negative relationship with the levels of dietary lipid and a positive relationship with the protein contents. These results suggest that fouling macroalgae have a great potential to be used as diets of abalone. © 2010 The Authors.

The cephalic, epipodial and mantle tentacles bear papillae with ciliary tufts at their tips. Chemoreceptors with 14-21 ciliated cells were found at high density on the snout. When the tentacles were touched with a bamboo rodor a piece of plastic sheet, the abalone contracted the tentacle stimulated, indicating mechanoreception. The contact of a piece of brown algae Laminaria japonica to any of three tentacles elicited a typical feeding response: shell lifting, pedal sole expansion and lifting, and food seizing with pedal sole. The response disappeared when the algae was separated from the tentacles, indicating that the ciliated cells were contact chemoreceptors as well as mechanoreceptors. A possibility of distant chemoreception was examined in a Y-maze in which seawater flowed over the algae and was directed towards the abalone. The algal stimulant triggered the food searching movement of the abalone which randomly chose both the stimulant containing water from the algal containing side and the control water without stimulant. This implies the possession of distant chemoreception possibly by the osphradium, but the abalone lacks a function to detect the origin of the smell. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952905243

First, a pebble coated with crustose coralline algae (CCA) was used to induce competent H. diversicolor larvae to metamorphose at 2, 5, 8, 12, or 17 days (Group A) or 2, 6, 10, or 12 days (Group B) after fertilization. To observe spontaneous attachment and metamorphosis, some larvae from Group B were maintained without the addition of a CCA-coated pebble. Rapid metamorphosis was observed in older larvae of both CCA-induced groups; 2 days after the addition of the CCA-coated pebble, 50-75% of the 2-day-old larvae and more than 85% of the 5-12-day-old larvae had metamorphosed. The percentage of spontaneously metamorphosed individuals increased 14 days after fertilization, reaching 50.6 ± 16.7% (mean ± S.E.) at 18 days. Second, metamorphosed post-larvae that had experienced larval periods of 5, 8, 11, or 15 days (Group A) or 4, 7, or 10 days (Group B) were reared at 26 °C with or without the benthic diatom Nitzchia ovalis as the sole food source. The survival and growth rates of the fed post-larvae in both groups decreased with the length of the larval swimming period; of the post-larvae from larvae of more than 7-11 days old, fewer than 70% still survived 16 days after metamorphosis. Mean growth rates during the 6 days after metamorphosis were lowest for the post-larvae from the larvae with the longest period of swimming. Third, newly settled post-larvae from 2-day-old larvae were reared at 26 °C with delays of 0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 days before first feeding (N. ovalis). Feeding delays of longer than 6 days dramatically depressed post-larval survival rates; approximately 1 week after the onset of feeding, more than 65% and fewer than 20% of the larvae subjected to feeding delays of 0-3 days or 6-12 days, respectively, still survived.

For successful recovery, supplementation may be necessary. To determine appropriate culture methods, juveniles were reared in habitat-enriched tanks (supplemented with rocks, macroalgae and sea urchins) or conventional aquaculture tanks and assessed for growth and survivorship in the laboratory over 15 months. No differences in survivorship or growth were observed. Subsequent experiments examined whether abalone behaviour (habitat selection and movement patterns) differed between rearing treatments. Abalone were exposed to one of three predator treatments (sea star arm, small crab, or no predator (control)) and filmed for 8 h. Abalone from habitat-enriched tanks changed habitats significantly more often than abalone from conventional tanks regardless of predator treatment. Significant differences in the percentage of time that abalone occupied the various habitats were also observed. Abalone in the sea star and control treatments primarily occupied the rocks, whereas abalone in the crab treatment behaved differently depending on the rearing method; conventionally reared abalone spent more time in corners, whereas abalone from habitat-enriched tanks spent more time exposed. These results demonstrate that rearing conditions can affect abalone behaviour and should be considered for abalone restoration efforts worldwide. © CSIRO 2009. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049194388

Four treatment diets were then investigated: a formulated diet; plantlets from culture Macrocystis pyrifera, Porphyra columbina from natural beds; and a mixed diet consisting of a blend of fresh P. columbina together with the formulated diet. This study was performed in a shallow aquaculture system with a horizontal water flow. After 90 days, significant differences were observed between treatments. The highest growth was obtained with Porphyra (3.3 mm month -1), followed by the mixed diet (2.6 mm month-1), then Macrocystis (2.1 mm month-1) and lastly the formulated diet (1.4 mm month-1). Moreover, after the diets were tested for stability and remnant nutrients after a 12-h water immersion, a positive trend appeared to be related to the protein/energy (P:E). It is concluded that fronds of P. columbina resulted in the best diet for weaning H. rufescens under horizontal water flow systems, even if apparently the water stability of the formulated diet had a negative impact on abalone performance, particularly due to a poor nutrient retention capacity. Therefore, formulated diets should be improved before being recommended for weaning red abalone. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350164326

This study examined the poorly understood feeding habits and preferences of H. iris in a series of laboratory experiments. Generally, H. iris consumed the blades of brown algae over red and green algae. However, when upright whole plants were given to H. iris, the highly preferred kelp Lessonia variegata was consumed in lower proportions than the less preferred but more accessible red alga Gigartina circumcincta. H. iris were less capable of reaching the blades or consuming the stipe of L. variegata, which has a stipe of ∼100-350 mm high. H. iris consumed greater amounts of drift over benthic L. vareigata. Water movement appeared to inhibit the active grazing of H. iris, but not the drift-trapping behavior, resulting in lower overall feeding rates for abalone under conditions of higher water movement. Abalone consumed fresh and aged algae equally. We conclude that H. iris feeds primarily on drift algae because preferred food sources are more accessible as drift than as attached macroalgae, and because this may be a more successful foraging strategy in the high flow environment this species commonly inhabits. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958600054

So it is very important to determine the waste excretion characteristics of aquatic animals for the development of practical and nonpolluting land-based aquaculture. Abalone has a unique feeding habit and feeding regime, different from those of finfish; abalone gnaw feed seaweed to produce feces and ammonia continuously.

Weight-standardized rates (ingestion, assimilation, respiration, ammonia excretion, and fecal excretion) of small (juvenile), medium (mature), and large (mature) sea cucumbers were measured and energy budgets constructed to quantify their growth rates when offered three different diets at 14, 16, and 18C. Three types of diet were offered: uneaten abalone food (diet A) and two types of abalone feces, one where abalone were fed 50% Macrocystis pyrifera and 50% Undaria pinnatifida macroalgae (diet B) and the other where abalone were fed 25% M.pyrifera, 25% U.pinnatifida, and 50% Adam & Amos Abalone Food, where the latter is an industry standard diet (diet C). The organic contents of the diets were much higher than natural sediments and varied such that diet A (76.40%)>diet B (54.50%)>diet C (37.00%). Diet had a significant effect on S.mollis ingestion rates, assimilation efficiencies, and consequently energy budgets and growth rates. Greater quantities of organic matter (OM) from diet A and diet B were ingested and assimilated by the sea cucumbers compared with the OM in diet C. The energy budgets indicated that after taking routine metabolism into account, all sizes of sea cucumbers had energy to allocate to growth when offered diet A and diet B, but only juveniles had energy to allocate to growth when offered diet C. Fecal excretion rates when offered diet A and diet C at 14C were greater than those at 18C, but neither was significantly different from that at 16C. Ammonia excretion rates increased nonlinearly with temperature for small and medium sea cucumbers but not for large sea cucumbers. Weight-standardized respiration rates increased with temperature and unexpectedly with animal size, which may have been because of the narrow weight range of test animals biasing the results. These results suggest that industry standard type abalone waste lacks sufficient energy to meet the metabolic requirements of mature sea cucumbers but that growing juveniles on these wastes appears to be feasible and warrants further investigation. © Copyright by the World Aquaculture Society 2009. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-65449126229

However, the detection of differences in morphology amongst variable environments cannot determine whether these differences represent a plastic response to the local environment, or whether morphology is genetically fixed. We used a reciprocal transplant experiment to test whether 'stunted' blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) are the result of a plastic response to the environment or fixed genetic trait. Furthermore, we related environmental factors, that affect food availability (density of abalone, water movement, algal cover and reef topography), to differences in growth and morphology. Morphological plasticity was confirmed as the mechanism causing morphological variation in H. rubra. Individuals transplanted to sites with 'non-stunted' H. rubra grew significantly faster when compared to stunted controls, whilst individuals transplanted to stunted sites grew significantly slower compared to non-stunted controls. The growth response was greater for individuals transplanted from 'non-stunted' to 'stunted' sites, suggesting that the environmental stressors in morphologically 'stunted' habitat are stronger compared to locations of faster growing morphology. We propose that these differences are related to resource availability whereby low algal cover and topographic simplicity results in stunted populations, whereas high algal abundance and topographic complexity results in non-stunted populations. © 2009 Springer-Verlag. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-64249116203

In intact algal beds, we used enclosures to estimate the effects and relative magnitude of intra- and interspecific competition on the body condition, gonad development and survival of C. rodgersii and H. rubra. An increased density of conspecifics led to declines in the dry gonad weight of C. rodgersii and in the dry foot and stomach content weights of H. rubra. The effects of interspecific competition were asymmetrical. Manipulations of H. rubra densities had no detectable effect on C. rodgersii. In contrast, in enclosures with added C. rodgersii, H. rubra showed reduced total and dry weights of stomach contents and increased mortality relative to controls without urchins. The effects of C. rodgersii on H. rubra could be linked to differences in feeding habits and morphology. C. rodgersii is a generalist herbivore, which, even at low densities, reduced the cover and standing biomass of total, brown and red algae relative to controls without urchins. In contrast, H. rubra is a specialist herbivore, which, even at high densities, had little effect on the cover and standing biomass of algae relative to the effect of C. rodgersii. This study suggests that the invader C. rodgersii is the superior competitor in interactions with H. rubra, and that its presence, even at low densities, affects the abalone fishery. © Inter-Research 2009. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-62149135843

Whether the defense capacity in these seaweeds is generally impaired by low-light stress was also investigated. Aquaria with blackened walls connected to a flow-through water system were used as Experimental Units (EUs). Different light regimes were established using layers of black gauze material and clear perspex lids, mounted on top of the EU. The gauze allowed the stepwise reduction of ambient light. Six different light levels with eight replicates each were realised. The growth rates of algal exposed to different light levels were calculated using a linear regression analysis. Using outdoor mesocosm facilities, three fully-factorial experiments were realised during which low-light stress on different algae-grazer combinations was induced: 1) the red algae Gracilaria edulis with the sea hare Aplysia sp., 2) G. edulis with the abalone Haliotis diversicolor, and 3) Gracilaria salicornia with H. diversicolor. For each combination, 48 aquaria were used, while in a control group of another 48 tanks, algae were kept in the absence of herbivores. Following low-light and feeding-stress induction, herbivore consumption on algal material was assessed in feeding assays with living thalli fragments. Negative effects of light reduction on algal growth rates was observed in both experiments with G. edulis and in one trial with G. salicornia, while general effects of low-light stress on seaweed palatability were absent in our study. By contrast, for some herbivore-algal combinations, significant differences in consumption were detected on previously-grazed and ungrazed algal material, that indicates the presence of an inducible defense. G. edulis and G. salicornia produced defenses when exposed to grazing by the gastropod Aplysia sp. and H. diversicolor, respectively. In contrast, G. edulis showed no response to H. diversicolor. Our findings show that inducible defenses generally exist in the two investigated Gracilaria species, but vary with the identity of herbivores. Surprisingly, algal palatability was not affected throughout all low-light regimes, contrasting the widespread notion that defensive traits in seaweeds are dependent on metabolic energy. Thus, it appears that low-light stress effects play only a minor role on the performance of antiherbivore defenses in these two red algae. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951760311

The potential of this new commercial crop is analysed. Material is collected from natural free-floating populations and at least four species are commonly grown, with different ecophysiological characteristics. A brown epiphyte, Myrionema strangulans, causes a disease of the Ulva, which is currently managed by farmers by re-stocking. The main potential threat is that some farmers are wary of integrated systems, fearing they may promote disease in abalone, although Ulva has been grown in abalone effluent and fed back to the abalone on one farm for 6years without adverse effects. Opportunities exist for the expansion of Ulva cultivation via further spread of the abalone industry, the inclusion of seaweed raceways in proposed fish-farming activities, or the potential for the inclusion of high quality cultivated Ulva as a constituent in aquafeed. A conservative estimate of production over a full year from these raceway systems was 26.1g dw m-2 day-1 (2006) and 19.7g dw m-2 day-1 (2007), similar to maximum figures for total annual microalgal biomass production in outdoor systems. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350385204

Five diets were formulated with different oil sources (palm, colza, fish, sunflower, and soybean), containing from 2.52% to 12.33% n3 HUFA, while fresh Ulva rigida was used as reference diet. The different diets were provided to groups of 20 abalone during 120 days in independent triplicates. Though no significant differences in growth (P < 0.05) were registered among all formulated diets, a tendency to accumulate different fatty acids in muscle was observed. The proximate composition of abalone tissue showed that the diet containing 6.8% HUFA resulted in higher lipid accumulation in muscle tissue than that observed in the other treatments. Our results suggest that H. tuberculata coccinea, contrary to to abalone species from colder environments, does not have high HUFA requirements; however, the fatty acid profile of muscle and viscera tissues of abalone may be modulated by the fatty acid content in diets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65749102615

In this study, Haliotis midae fed a kelp diet supplemented with Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain C4 exhibited an increased growth rate compared to abalone fed standard kelp feed both under laboratory and farm conditions. The growth rate of antibiotic-treated H. midae was extremely poor in comparison to abalone that had not been treated with antibiotics when fed an unsupplemented kelp diet, reflecting the importance of gastrointestinal microflora in abalone growth. Alginate lyase activity in the H. midae digestive tract was significantly higher in abalone fed kelp supplemented with strain C4 compared to abalone fed unsupplemented kelp. Antibiotic-treated abalone incorporated 14C-labelled strain C4 proteins into their tissue. Although most of the radiolabelled bacterial protein was incorporated into the hepatopancreas, incorporation was also observed in the gills, foot, adductor muscle and intestine. Thus, the Pseudoalteromonas strain tested in this study shows tremendous potential for use as a probiotic in abalone aquaculture, particularly with regard to improving the nutritional status and digestibility of the feed and hence, increasing the growth rate of farmed H. midae. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Over 6,000 t per annum of kelp Ecklonia maxima are now harvested for this purpose, and some kelp beds are reaching maximum sustainable limits. Research into seaweed aquaculture as feed (Ulva and some Gracilaria) for abalone started in the late 1990s on the southeast coast (where there are no kelp beds) using abalone waste water. A growing body of evidence suggests that a mixed diet of kelp plus other seaweeds can give growth rates at least as good as compound feed, and can improve abalone quality and reduce parasite loads. A pilot scale Ulva lactuca and abalone integrated recirculation unit using 25% recirculation was designed and built on the south west coast of South Africa using one 12,000-L abalone tank containing 13,200 15±2.5 g abalone, connected to two 3,000-L seaweed tanks containing an initial starting biomass of 10 kg of seaweed, replicated 3 times. In an 18-month period, there were no significant differences in abalone health or growth rates, sediment build up and composition, mobile macro fauna densities and species between the recirculation or the flow-through units. Transfer of oxygen generated by the seaweeds to the abalone tanks was poor, resulting in the recirculated abalone tanks having lower (33%) dissolved oxygen concentrations than a comparable flow-through abalone unit. Seaweed nutrient content and specific growth rates in the units were comparable to seaweeds cultivated in fertilized effluent (SGR=3.2±3.4%.day-1; Yield=0.2±0.19 kg.m2.day-1). Indications were that at this low recirculation ratio the seaweeds in the units were nutrient limited and that there were no negative effects to the abalone being cultivated in such a recirculation unit at this recirculation ratio. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149260337

More than ten species are commercially used to produce phycocolloids, fertilizers, plant growth control products, human food or animal fodder and feed additives. These multiple uses of algae offer a number of possibilities for coupling this activity to salmon, abalone and filter-feeder farming. In this context, different experiments carried out in Chile have demonstrated that Gracilaria chilensis and Macrocystis pyrifera have great potential in the development of an integrated aquaculture strategy. The present Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) approach study showed that Gracilaria can be cultured best at 1 m depth whereas Macrocystis has an especially good growth response at 3 m depth. Both species use available nitrogen efficiently. On the other hand, high intensities of solar radiation (UV and PAR) can be critical at low depths of cultivation, and our results indicate that both species show photosynthetic susceptibility mainly at noon during the summer. The demand of Macrocystis for abalone feeding is increasing, thus improving the opportunity for developing an integrated nutrient waste recycling activity in Chile. Although Gracilaria shows a higher nitrogen uptake capacity than Macrocystis, its market value does not yet allow a massive commercial scaling. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149241169

Chondrus canaliculatus is a red alga endemic to the temperate Pacific coast of South America and produces a complex carrageenan. In Chile, this potential marine resource has been underutilized since the early 1990s, after it was replaced mainly by imports of Kappaphycus and Eucheum from Asia. The study of the cultivation of C. canaliculatus in outdoor tanks demonstrates the potential to produce large quantities of algal material due to the high productivity observed. The material produced may be important in Chile as feed for cultured algal herbivores such as Haliotis spp. Data were obtained on the key factors affecting the growth of this alga, including light, temperature, and nutrient concentrations. The results showed that, on a dry weight basis, productivity varied seasonally between 40 g m-3 wk-1 in autumn and 200 g m-3 wk-1 in spring, and the optimal stocking density in our experiments was 8 kg m-3.

PGE<inf>2</inf> amount increased nearly 2-fold and 47% when the seaweed was exposed to two ways of fluctuation of seawater salinity from 2% to 1% and 3% for 12 hr, respectively. The stresses of low temperature and irradiance promoted the seaweed to produce PGE2.

Infections are rare and are most often associated with the immunocompromised host. A study was performed on the microbiological flora of oysters and seawater from commercial oyster harvesting sites in the Delaware Bay, New Jersey. From 276 water and shellfish samples tested, 1,421 bacterial isolates were picked for biochemical identification and 170 (12.0%) of the isolates were presumptively identified as S. putrefaciens, 26 (1.8%) were presumptively identified as P. damselae subsp. damselae, and 665 (46.8%) could not be identified using the API 20E identification database. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of 22 S. putrefaciens-like isolates identified them as S. abalonesis, S. algae, S. baltica, S. hafniensis, S. marisflavi, S. putrefaciens, Listonella anguillarum, and P. damselae. Beta-hemolysis was produced by some S. algae and P. damselae isolates, while isolates of S. baltica and L. anguillarum, species perceived as nonpathogenic, also exhibited β-hemolysis and growth at 37°C. To our knowledge, this is the first time these beta-hemolytic strains were reported from shellfish or seawater from the Delaware Bay. Pathogenic Shewanella and Photobacterium species could pose a health threat through the ingestion of contaminated seafood, by cuts or abrasions acquired in the marine environment, or by swimming and other recreational activities.

The experiment included 10 diet treatments with two replicates each (n = 50 individuals per replicate). The first five diet treatments comprised four fishmeal-based formulated feeds: Abfeed®, Adam & Amos® 'a', Adam & Amos® 'b' and Adam & Amos® 'c'; and an all-seaweed-based formulated pellet, FeedX. The additional five diet treatments comprised the formulated feeds above, supplemented with fresh wild seaweeds: the kelp Ecklonia maxima (5-15% protein) and Ulva lactuca (3.7-19.9% protein). The fishmeal-based protein feeds produced significantly better growth than the all-seaweed-based protein feed (FeedX: 0.49 ± 0.03 specific growth rate [SGR]; 27.15 ± 0.02 daily increment increase in shell length [DISL]; 0.864 final condition factor [CF]). Abfeed® (1.00 ± 0.02 SGR; 60.79 ± 0.04 DISL; 1.312 final CF) performed best of all the formulated feeds.

A noteworthy observation was that the condition factor of abalone fed the feed that performed particularly poorly in the growth trials (FeedX) was dramatically improved by supplementation. It was shown that supplementation with fresh wild seaweed enhances the growth of abalone reared on formulated feeds.

To counter grazing effects, constitutive and induced anti-herbivory responses evolved in seaweeds. Feeding-assayed induction experiments were conducted in the laboratory to investigate whether 14 d grazing periods by either the periwinkle Littorina brevicula or the abalone Haliotis discus induced anti-herbivory defences in the green alga Ulva pertusa and the brown alga Laminaria japonica. Where appropriate, assays were repeated with artificial food containing lipophilic algal extracts, using dichloromethane (DCM) as a solvent, to test whether or not snails induced chemical defences. While exposure to periwinkles reduced palatability of fresh L. japonica pieces for naïve conspecific grazers, no such effect was displayed by abalone-exposed L. japonica pieces. Patterns of grazer specificity in the palatability of fresh algae were not confirmed when using artificial food containing algal DCM extracts. This suggests that L. japonica either induced morphological defences or periwinkle-deterrent substances originated from the non-lipophilic fraction of defensive chemicals. Grazer-specific induced responses were not apparent in U. pertusa assays. This study revealed that the induction of chemical anti-herbivory responses depends not only on the type of grazer but also on the type of alga on which the grazer feeds. © Inter-Research 2008. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-39049147347

High quality protoplasts suitable for electrophysiological studies were isolated from the green marine alga, Ulva pertusa, using enzyme mixtures consisting of cellulase and abalone power and identified by calcofluor fluorescence. The vitality of protoplasts varied depending on the alga growth stage, and those isolated from younger tissue in March maintained a high vitality with high sealing success rate compared with protoplasts isolated from mature or non-growing plants in August or November. In the whole-cell configuration, large inward currents were elicited by negative voltage pulses. The voltage-dependent component was predominantly carried by Cl-, as confirmed by the use of the Cl- channel inhibitor DIDS and reversal potential of current-voltage plots. This evidence suggests that hyperpolarization-activated Cl- permeable channels are responsible for the influx of Cl- into U. pertusa cells.

In the northern hemisphere, adult abalone are considered to consume predominantly brown algae, but in the southern hemisphere abalone are thought to prefer red algae. Conventional methods such as gut content analysis and feeding trials provide some insight into diet choice, but the associated biases of these techniques create uncertainty surrounding the aforementioned variability in abalone diet. We use combined stable isotope and fatty acid analysis to determine the relative contribution of red algae, brown algae and detritus/microalgae to the diet of wild abalone in Tasmanian waters. Stable isotopes of carbon suggest that brown algae and/detritus are a more important source of carbon than red algae. Fatty acid analysis confirmed the larger contribution of brown algae to the diet of abalone, and also identified the bacterial and diatom component of detritus to be an important contributor to abalone diet. These results show combined use of chemical tracers to be a promising technique for resolving abalone diet, and challenge current perceptions regarding spatial variability in abalone diet choice. © 2007 Springer-Verlag. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349134773

At present, 100% of Chile's abalone enterprises farm the H. rufescens species, owing to its suitability for full-cycle culture. In the analysis of factors that facilitate the development of abalone farming in Chile, those that stand out include the characteristics of the aquatic ecosystem, existing entrepreneurial and professional skills, decisive government support in co-financing scientific and technological projects, infrastructure and associated services to support these development initiatives and a market where prices have remained stable and demand for abalone products has been steady. The greatest challenges facing intensive abalone farming in Chile are providing a constant supply of macroalgae for abalone feed and developing complementary feed, as well as updating current legislation on intensive abalone farming, strengthening producer associations and establishing health certification. The article discusses examples of the impact that native organisms can have on animals introduced into an aquatic ecosystem and the international transmission of agents such as withering syndrome and sabellid polychaete infestation disease, associated with the movement of abalone seeds and broodstock.

STXs are transferred and bioaccumulate throughout aquatic food webs, and can be vectored to terrestrial biota, including humans. Fisheries closures and human intoxications due to STXs have been documented in several non-traditional (i.e. non-filter-feeding) vectors. These include, but are not limited to, marine gastropods, both carnivorous and grazing, crustacea, and fish that acquire STXs through toxin transfer.

Knowing the DMSP levels in feeds and its behaviour in abalone tissue will lead to the development of new strategies for controlling abalone taste characteristics. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Cultures were carried out in lantern and basket nets suspended in seawater tanks having a constant flow of fresh seawater from La Herradura Bay. A total of 900 juveniles were observed, starting with individuals having an average length of 20 mm. The abalone juveniles were fed with two species of macroalgae, half of which was Gracilaria chilensis, and the other was half Ulva sp (mass basis), fed ad libitum. Artificial pelletized food was fed as a supplement, at a rate of 2% of the body mass of the abalones daily. Water quality in the cultures was monitored twice daily, included water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and water flow rate. The average survival of the abalones at the termination of the experimental period was 96.2% in the lantern nets, and 94.6% in the culture baskets, although these differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05; nested ANOVA). The highest mean specific growth rates were obtained in the lantern net systems with rates of 0.34% per day in length and 1.02% per day in weight; comparative values for the basket systems were 0.31% per day and 0.86% per day. Higher growth rates for weight and length of the shell were obtained in the lantern systems than in the basket culture systems. An analysis of covariance of values for growth in weight and length of the abalones showed significant differences between results from the lantern and basket systems (P < 0.05). Based on the results of the study, the lantern systems should be considered as an interesting alternative for the culture of Haliotis discus hannai both in land-based cultures, and at sea, because they have a larger carrying capacity for abalones compared with the baskets in the culture tanks and only occupy one third of the water column space. The lantern nets not only provided the best growth, but were also more economical, and easier to handle than the baskets. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34648833319

To provide the red algal species in a diet suitable for juvenile abalone three propagation methods; spore production, protoplast isolation, and fragment culture were investigated. The potential algae requirements and consumable costs for each propagation method were determined, using experimental data and values from the literature, to assess the viability of utilizing each of these propagation methods in a commercial abalone nursery. The use of red algal spores required 592-52,000 kg of algae, depending on the level of spore release and the percentage of fertile algal thalli collected. Protoplast isolation reduced the amount of algal biomass to 8.55-910 kg but was affected by the efficiency of the isolation procedure. Even at an efficient production of 1 × 108 protoplasts·g-1 wet weight alga the cost of consumables (enzymes) was $US 13,576. A feeding trial utilizing Laureneia sp. fragments adhered to the plates using agar, produced juvenile abalone growth rates comparable to those obtained with the current commercial nursery diet of the green alga Ulvella lens plus the diatom Navicula cf. jeffreyi. The Laurencia fragments did not regenerate on the plates so it was reapplied weekly, which is not feasible on a commercial scale because it would require 10.6 t of Laureneia and 443 kg of agar at a cost of $US 34,899. Gracilaria sp. fragments were able to regenerate with a growth rate of 4.42%·day-1 and therefore the algal fragments would only need to be applied to the PVC plates once, at the start of the later nursery phase (5 mm SL), reducing the amount of algal biomass to 432 kg. We therefore conclude that regenerating fragment culture (fragments <1 mm) is the only method that could successfully produce red algal diets for juvenile abalone on a commercial scale in the later nursery phase. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34648830929

The red abalone Haliotis rufescens was introduced in 1977 and the ezo abalone Haliotis discus hannai in 1982. After several years of research and development, the industry began in 1992 and Chile is currently the fifth producer of cultured abalone in the world with 304 tons in 2006. Twenty five companies are involved in this Chilean industry, culturing mainly red abalone. Most of the farms in the North include hatcheries and land-based grow-out operations, whereas most of the in-water grow-out facilities are located in the South. All farms in Chile use algae as the main food for growing abalone, but artificial feeds are also used in some land-based operations in the North. The average size of abalone harvested in Chile is 8 cm (100-120 g) after 3-5 y in culture systems. Whole frozen abalone (shell on) is the most important form of this Chilean product (82% in 2006) and the main market is Japan (90.2%). Abalone production has increased at a rate of around 50% per annum over the last 3 y. This development is expected to continue in the next years, fostered by favorable geographic, economic, and environmental conditions as well as an important government support to invest in abalone. A survey among producers revealed that feed availability and quality is currently considered a key issue to further develop this industry in Chile. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34648827906

At that stage animals need to be moved into a different tank system and weaned onto a formulated feed or alternative algal diets consisting of diatoms or macroalgae that can provide more biomass for the growing juveniles. Two trials were conducted to compare the growth and survival of juvenile greenlip abalone (5.9 ± 0.6 and 7.1 ± 0.1 mm in initial shell length) in two rearing systems: (1) shallower tanks with or without horizontal shelter, feeding a commercial formulated feed on horizontal surfaces; (2) deeper tanks with plate system feeding algal diets. The second experiment included two algal diets and two abalone stocking densities for one of the algal diets. The first experiment revealed that the algal diet consisting of Ulvella lens produced the best growth rates during the first 4 wk of the experiment, when juveniles reached about 9 mm in shell length and seawater temperatures averaged 20.1°C. Growth rates on the Ulvella diet declined rapidly thereafter, whereas growth rates on formulated feeds increased, coinciding with a decrease in seawater temperature to 15.2°C at the end of the experiment. The formulated feed produced high growth rates (over 75 μm day-1) once juveniles reached 7 mm in shell length. In the second experiment, the algal diet that included germlings of the green alga Ulva sp. produced the highest growth rates (105 μm day-1), indicating that Ulva sp. germlings are a suitable additional food source for juvenile greenlip abalone. Growth rates were particularly high towards the end of the experiment when seawater temperatures were above 19°C. Juveniles stocked at higher density (80 juveniles per plate) feeding on one of the algal diets showed reduced growth rates and overall lower average weight gain per individual compared with the juveniles stocked at low density and juveniles in the tank system feeding on formulated diet. In both experiments the survival was higher on the algal diets (77% to 82%) than on the formulated feed (62% to 65%). Culturing and maintaining algae for larger juveniles in the nursery system involved more labor, compared with the tank systems feeding formulated feed, suggesting that in higher labor cost countries, juveniles should be weaned onto a formulated feed as early as possible. We recommend moving animals into a tank system to feed formulated feed once they reach 7 mm in shell length. The weaning process can be delayed (e.g., to 17 mm shell length) by supplementing with macroalgal germlings if the seawater temperature is high and high mortality is expected when weaning onto formulated diets. The algal diet including Ulva sp. germlings produced particularly high growth rates when seawater temperature was above 19°C. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34648816223

Of 16 diatom strains tested in Experiment 1, half induced ≥80% attachment and >50% metamorphosis within 4 days. Settlement success did not correlate significantly with diatom abundance or adhesive strength (P > 0.05). Several diatom strains interfered with settlement. Examples included (1) smothering by highly mobile diatoms (Nitzschia longissima); (2) shells becoming stuck to sticky secretions (Navicula britannica, Achnanthes longipes); and (3) unstable diatom cells preventing pedal attachment (Licmophora sp.). In Experiment 2, only 1 of 15 diatom strains induced over 70% metamorphosis, and three others induced 22-36% metamorphosis, within 4 days. Older cultures of a strain induced higher attachment and metamorphosis than younger cultures of the same strain (P < 0.001), but some old cultures still gave poor settlement. For the young diatom cultures, larval attachment correlated positively with diatom percent cover (r = 0.89, P < 0.05), and metamorphosis with the growth phase of the diatom film (r = 0.91, P < 0.05). Experiments 3-5 examined the role of bacteria in settlement induction by diatom films. In Experiment 3, films of 8 diatom species from Experiment 1 were regrown from ∼6 individually isolated and rinsed cells, likely altering the associated bacterial flora. Metamorphosis was 179 fold lower on average than in Experiment 1 (P < 0.0001), but attachment and diatom density were not significantly different (P = 0.87 and P = 0.75 respectively). In Experiment 4, Nitzschia ovalis grown and assayed with antibiotics had lower metamorphosis after 2 days than the same strain grown and assayed without antibiotics (6 vs 64%, P = 0.004), whereas attachment after 2 days did not differ (94 versus 92%, P = 0.49). In Experiment 5 bacteria from a Nitzschia ovalis culture induced as much attachment and metamorphosis as the intact diatom film, whereas cell-free supernatant was much less effective. The presence of antibiotics in settlement assays reduced attachment and metamorphosis by biofilms, but not by coralline algae (Phymatolithon repandum) or GABA. In Experiment 5 metamorphosis on diatoms and bacteria occurred gradually over 2 wk, whereas on coralline algae and GABA it occurred within a few days. This study suggests that many diatoms cue rapid larval attachment, but few induce consistently strong metamorphosis within 4 days in laboratory conditions. The bacteria present in diatom films affect the settlement-inducing activity of the film in at least some cases. The effectiveness of diatom films was generally higher for more mature films but overall, physical factors explained little of the variation in the activity of diatoms. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-36649034279

All specimens were captured by trammel nets. As the feeding ecology of the brown wrasse is still unknown in the southern coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, the main purpose of this paper was to provide a qualitative and quantitative description of the brown wrasse trophic behaviour. 23.33% of the investigated specimens had empty stomachs. There were no significative variation of the vacuity index depending on sex and length. The minimal values registered during the rest period showed the compensation of the energy loss. The preys were generally composed by benthic invertebrates. The major food categories are crustaceans decapods (Pagurus oculatus and Pagurus anachoretus) and molluscan gastropods (Haliotis tuberculata, Jujubinus exasperatus, Gibbula divaricata and Calliostoma laugieri). The annelid polychaetes Pontogenia chrysocoma were frequently eaten as a secondary prey species. Despite its carnivorous character, the brown wrasse also consumes algae species (Antithamnion plumula) and seagrass such as Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa. This accidental ingestion is probably due to the consumption of prey species confined in the seaweeds and the rocky substrata. The seasonal variations of the diet don't indicate any significative differences especially for the crustaceans and the molluscs groups. The secondary and complementary preys are ingested randomly. There was no relationship between dietary and length of maturity for males and females. However, only annelid group ingestion showed differences between mature and immature female diet. Although its main food is composed by crustaceans decapods and molluscs gastropods.

The percentages of larval settlement differed significantly among algal species, and were significantly higher on two red algal species (Marginisporum crassissima, an articulated coralline alga, and Gelidium elegans, an agarophyte) than on the green algae, brown algae and benthic diatoms tested. Marginisporum crassissima induced larval settlement most strongly throughout the experiments. The percentage of larval settlement on a crustose coralline alga (unidentified species), which is known as a suitable substratum for abalone larvae, was much lower than on M. crassissima and G. elegans, which have morphologically complex growth forms. The percentage of settled individuals on ethanol-killed M. crassissima was much lower than on intact M. crassissima. The results indicate that physical structure is unlikely to be the main inducer of settlement; therefore, settlement of top shell larvae seems to be strongly induced by chemicals from the two red algal species. The specific distribution of juvenile top shell in the field may be at least partly determined by the strong induction of larval settlement by articulated coralline and gelidiacean algae. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34147114384

However, the role of chemical defences in filamentous algae has received far less attention. We investigated possible chemical feeding deterrence by filamentous red algae that have conspicuous cellular inclusions (Asparagopsis armata, Anotrichium tenue and Balliella amphiglanda) and 2 others without inclusions (Callithamnion korfense and Ulva sp.). The 3 algae with cellular inclusions were consumed at lower rates by a generalist amphipod, Hyale nigra, than the other 2 algae. To determine the potential role of chemical defences for A. armata, we conducted tests against herbivores using algae in which the production of halogenated metabolites was manipulated. This manipulation had no effect on carbon and nitrogen values of the algae, and allowed us to directly test the role of algal secondary metabolites in defence against herbivores without using artificial diets. Bromide (+) algae (with halogenated metabolites) deterred grazing by 2 mesograzers (Hyale nigra and juvenile abalone Haliotis rubra), which consumed up to 4 times more bromide (-) (metabolite-free) algae than bromide (+) algae. Juveniles of the sea hare Aplysia parvula were not deterred by the chemical defences in bromide (+) A. armata. In field assays, artificial diets containing a crude extract of A. armata were also active against herbivores. Although functional form models typically predict that tolerance - not resistance - should be the key defensive strategy for marine algae with simple architecture, this study demonstrates that resistance traits may also be important and more broadly utilised in filamentous species. © Inter-Research 2006. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750630858

Carpoblepharis flaccida, Gelidium vittatum and Polysiphonia virgata are conspicuous red algal epiphytes on older kelps and provide habitat and food for numerous animals. Over 4.5 y, we examined the effects of one destructive harvest of E. maxima on these 3 epiphytes. Two 20 x 20 m plots of kelp with similar epiphyte loads were demarcated. In one, all E. maxima sporophytes with stipes longer than 50 cm were harvested. The other plot served as a control. After 2.5 y the biomass of E. maxima in the harvested plot had recovered to control levels, but the epiphyte load (g epiphytes. Kg kelp-1) was statistically lower in the harvested plot after 2.5 and 3.5 y, and only recovered after 4.5 y. While most commercial harvesters cut through the ""heads"" (primary blades) of the kelp, effectively killing them, a new, non-lethal method removes secondary blades 20-30 cm from their bases, leaving the meristems and primary blades intact. At 5 sites studied, G. vittatum and P. virgata were found almost entirely on stipes and primary blades, and harvesting only distal parts of secondary blades limited losses to about 50% of C. flaccida biomass. To protect epiphytes, non-lethal harvesting is recommended and permanent non-harvest zones have been established in addition to limiting kelp yields and disallowing harvesting in Marine Protected Areas. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845421114

Growth of juvenile Haliotis midae was monitored on a commercial abalone farm over a period of 9 months in an experiment consisting of 9 treatments with 4 replicates (n = 250 individuals per replicate). The treatments were: fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima) blades (seaweed control); Abfeed® (formulated feed control); kelp + Abfeed® dried kelp pellets; dried kelp blades; dried kelp stipes; fresh kelp with the epiphyte Carpoblepharis flaccida; a mixed diet (Gracilaria gracilis, Ulva lactuca, and kelp) and a rotational diet (abalone were fed 1 of the 9 treatments for the first week and them kelp for the next 3 weeks). Results show that abalone grow well on all fresh seaweed combinations, but grow best on a mixed diet. The likely reason for the success of the mixed diet is that the red and green seaweed was farm grown, with an increased protein content. Dried kelp in any form produced poor growth. Abalone fed on the mixed diet grew at 0.066 mm day-1 shell length and 0.074 g day-1 body weight; this corresponds to 24.09 mm shell length and 27.01 g body weight increase per annum. Abalone fed on dried kelp grew at only 0.029 mm day-1 shell length and of 0.021 g day-1 body weight. Abalone grown on Abfeed® grew at 0.049 mm day-1 shell length and 0.046 g day-1 body weight which corresponds to 17.88 mm and 16.79 g increase per annum; this is better than the dried seaweed feeds, but poorer than the fresh seaweed combinations.

As a result, stripping the spats (3-5 mm) off by anaesthetization and switching the diet from live diatoms to artificial powdered diet in combination has to be performed in most of the abalone farms. This manipulation normally leads to more than 50% mortality. Here we report the direct use of the unicellular green alga Platymonas helgolandica Kylin var. tsingtaoensis as a potential alga to be used to settle the veliger larvae of the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai and to feed the postlarvae. Settlement rate of 2-day-old veliger larvae in mono culture of P. helgolandica could be as high as 92% (± 4.2%) on day 10 in small scale trials, higher than that in the selected benthic diatom strain (53.6% ± 12.7%) when settled in the water in which bacteria propagation was controlled by treatment of 2 ppm of benzylpenicillinum calcium and streptomycin sulfate. Postlarvae fed solely on P. helgolandica or the selected benthic diatom Navicula-2005-A grew at rates of 40.1 (± 1.9) and 45.8 (± 3.4) μm day- 1, respectively, when raised at 22 °C until day 50 postfertilization. P. helgolandica was shown to have distinct diurnal settling rhythm characterized with a peak of settled cells in the middle of the night for cell division and a peak of free-swimming cells in the middle of the day. High density of attached P. helgolandica cells on the inner surface of the culture facility in the night fits the nocturnal feeding behavior of the abalone spats. Judged by the promising larvae settling rate, growth and survival rates of the postlarvae fed with this alga, the free-swimming micro-green alga P. helgolandica constitutes a potential species for settling the veliger larvae and for supporting the growth of postlarvae as well. © 2006. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746937114

In aquaculture situations, abalone are usually provided with static artificial food pellets, effectively removing the tactile stimulus. This study investigated the effects of tactile stimuli from suspended particles on pellet ingestion, growth, behaviour and meat quality of juvenile paua (length 40-45 mm). Over eleven months, individuals were offered a commercial pellet diet (AbFeed™) and small quantities of one of four particulate materials: macerated seaweed (Gracilaria spp. and Macrocystis pyrifera) and 2 sizes of synthetic PVC fragments. There was seasonal variation in the ingestion rate of abalone from all treatments and the control (no stimulants) with lowest rates during winter (June to September) and highest rates in summer (December to February).The specific growth rate (% body weight gain per day) and shell length increase varied seasonally. Of the four treatments, the only effective stimulant was Gracilaria spp. which resulted in summer shell growth of 110.6 ± 3.2 μm d- 1 compared with 86.9 ± 4.0 μm d- 1 for control abalone. Behavioural observations showed that when Gracilaria particles were present, abalone spent > 80% of their time engaged in feeding-related activity. Control abalone, without the algal stimulant, spent most of their time in a sedentary position. None of the particulate stimulants tested had any significant effect on food conversion ratio, water content, protein, lipid and glycogen levels or meat tenderness. These parameters were, however, significantly affected by season. A preliminary trial of the Gracilaria particle treatment in a commercial system over 90 days enhanced the growth of cultured H. iris (45 ± 5 mm shell length) by 15.3%. The main commercial implication of this research is that the addition of algal stimulants is suggested as a cost-effective means of improving abalone performance using pre-existing culture systems and food types. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

With a rapid decline in wild abalone fisheries, farming now dominates the abalone export market in South Africa. Kelp (Ecklonia maxima) constitutes the major feed for farmed abalone in South Africa, but this resource is now approaching limits of sustainable harvesting in kelp Concession Areas where abalone farms are concentrated. This paper gives an overview of the development of the South African abalone industry and analyses how abalone farming, natural kelp beds and seaweed harvesting are interlinked. It discusses options and constraints for expanding the abalone industry, focussing especially on abalone feed development to meet this growing demand. Kelp will continue to play an important role as feed and kelp areas previously not utilised may become cost-effective to harvest. There are many benefits from on-farm seaweed production and it will probably be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry. Abalone waste discharges are not at present regarded as a major concern and farming brings important employment opportunities to lower income groups in remote coastal communities and has positive spillover effects on the seaweed industry and abalone processing industry. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The high costs involved in such culture systems generated the interest to evaluate the possibility to culture the abalone confined to cages in the sea. Introduction of this species into the natural environment may pose risks to local flora and fauna, particularly the establishment of populations arising from escaped specimens or larval settlement. Laboratory experiments were carried out to evaluate interactions between this abalone and local species in order to determine rates of consumption of local algae by these molluscs, competition with other organisms occupying the same feeding niche, and predation on the abalone by some local carnivores. The experiments demonstrated consumption of all offered algae by the abalone, particularly Rhodymenia howeana at rates of 1.3% to 5% of their body weight per day. In competition with other species of herbivores it was observed that with some there was a decline in consumption rate both by the abalone and the competitors when they were together, suggesting occurrence of competitive interference. The abalone readily attracted and were consumed by a variety of predators, particularly Meyenaster gelatinosus and Cancer setosus. It was concluded that if H. discus hannai escapes from the cages or produces larvae which settle on rocky reefs, this species might become established as an additional component of the natural communities. However, due to competitive interactions, predation pressure, and an opportunistic fishery, the development of substantial populations, let alone population explosions, with serious negative environmental impacts is improbable. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In floating net cage, marketable sizes were obtained at the age of 457-822-day old (15-27-month old) with highest growth rate of 2.36% g day-1 and 0.21 mm day-1. One advantage of the plastic tank culture system was that the tokobushi shell remained clean throughout the culture period. Macroalgal food affected the growth rate; Sargassum fusiforme (Setchell)- and Ulva pertusa (Kjellman)-fed tokobushi were better than Meristotheca papulosa (Montagne)-fed. Further, 1-year-old tokobushi had better growth performance and condition index than the 2-year-old cohort, and growth rates were higher at 17°C than at 12°C.

The diet of female broodstock and the conditioning regimen are likely to influence these parameters. In this study we examine the effect of broodstock diet (three formulated diets differing in levels of the fatty acid, Arachidonic acid [ARA], and a red seaweed diet) and spawning frequency on egg diameter variability both within a batch of eggs spawned from one female and between batches of eggs. Greenlip abalone broodstock were spawned at the beginning of the experiment and again every 16 wks (1131°C days effective accumulative temperature [EAT]) using commercial hatchery practices. The variability of egg diameter within batches spawned from the same female over three consecutive spawning rounds and within diet treatments was determined. Cytoplasm diameter, vitelline layer and jelly coat thickness of unfertilized eggs were also compared between eggs spawned from individual females and between females. In addition, the relationships between broodstock parameters (weight and shell length) and egg diameter were explored. Eggs spawned from females feeding on a red seaweed diet were smaller than eggs from the low ARA treatment. Depending on spawning frequency, broodstock diet can influence the cytoplasm diameter and jelly coat thickness. No relationship between egg diameter and broodstock parameters was found. However, batches spawned from the same female abalone became more variable over time with a shift in size frequency distribution. Results indicate that the variability of egg diameter within a batch changes from female to female and highlights the importance of selecting successful broodstock for conditioning at commercial hatcheries. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646698874

In the natural environment, abalone larvae settle on coralline red algae, which provide one of the strongest and most consistent settlement cues available for abalone larvae. However, propagation of coralline red algae is not practical commercially. Abalone farms in Japan successfully settle abalone larvae (Haliotis discus hannai) on the green alga Ulvella lens. U. lens also proved to be suitable to enhance settlement of cultured southern Australian abalone species (Haliotis laevigata, H. rubra). Most abalone farms in Australia are now growing U. lens for that purpose. U. lens is easy to culture, no specific facilities are needed and the alga can be grown on PVC settlement plates in commercial nursery tanks. However, U. lens has limited value as a feed for young postlarvae. Instead, cultured diatoms can be added after larvae successfully settle and start feeding. Juvenile abalone (>3 mm in shell length) can consume U. lens and grow rapidly on this alga. Diatom cultures and biofilms developing on settlement plates are not axenic and the role of bacteria in early postlarvae feeding is poorly understood. It has been suggested that bacteria may perform metabolic activities in the undeveloped gut of young postlarvae. At later stages of the nursery phase it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adequate feed on the plates and this is still regarded as a significant bottleneck for the abalone aquaculture industry. Recent investigations have indicated that sporelings of macroalgae like Ulva sp. or diatoms that can provide more biomass may provide a suitable additional food source for juveniles (>3 mm in shell length). © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646685459

Brown algae have 24-methylcholesta-5,24(28)-dien-3β-ol with δ13C value of -19.1 ± 0.1‰ and δD value of -298 ± 4‰, and 24-ethylcholesta-5,24(28)E-dien-3β-ol with δ13C value of -20.3 ± 0.2‰ and δD value of -301 ± 1‰.

The δ13C and δD values of these sterols in algae are consistent with those of algal sterols found in marine sediments, suggesting that the isotopic compositions of algal sterols are well preserved in sediments with little change due to heterotrophic effects. The three shellfish have a wide diversity of sterol types but most sterols, except cholest-5-en-3β-ol, have quite similar isotope compositions (δ13C value of -19.5 ± 0.4‰ and δD value of -296 ± 5‰) to the dietary algal sterols.

Many aspects of such polyculture systems have been described, but little attention has been given to the impact of live seaweeds on the microbiological properties of the water that connects the algae and animals. In this investigation, the Pacific red alga Gracilaria textorii was cultured in a recirculated dual tank system (150 L) with the juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Dynamic changes of total bacteria (TB) and total Vibrio (TV) in the water of polyculture and monoculture systems were evaluated. Results revealed that (1) level of TB in the polyculture was constantly higher than in the monoculture over a 6.5-day period. While levels of TV in the polyculture was detected to be constantly lower than in the monoculture, (2) integration of G. textorii in the abalone culture changed the Vibrio compositions in the water as judged by the changes of bacteria colony types; (3) application of artificial diet led to dramatic increase of the levels in TB and TV in both systems at 12 h after application in the 24-h test and resulted in selective propagation of Vibrio in the water in the monoculture system; (4) polyculture of G. textorii with juvenile abalone in combination with feeding with live algal diet helped to maintain low levels of TV and the balance of the Vibrio composition; (5) living biomass of G. textorii was effective in preventing propagation of two purified Vibrio strains (V. alginolaticus and V. logei) in the water. These results provide a general basis of the dynamic changes of levels in TB and TV in a seaweed-abalone polyculture system with or without artificial diet in tanks. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Selection for phenotypically plastic antiherbivory responses has been suggested for many plants, including a few species of seaweed, but little is known about its specificity or seasonality. 2 Multi-factorial experiments tested the effects of consumer identity (Littorina brevicula vs. Haliotis discus) and season (summer vs. autumn) on the induction of antiherbivory defences in the brown seaweed Ecklonia cava. Following a grazer-free acclimation phase, algae were incubated with grazers (treatment phase) and, subsequently, without grazers (recovery phase). Feeding preference assays, were used to assess differences in consumption rates between grazer-exposed and control plants. 3 In summer, Littorina, but not Haliotis, induced defence in Ecklonia. This defence vanished by the end of the recovery phase. In autumn, neither exposure to direct attack nor to waterborne cues induced defensive responses. 4 Both consumer identity and season of consumption can influence the ability of a given macroalgal species to induce antiherbivory defences. Tailoring such responses to spatial and temporal variation in grazer pressure could have profound ecological implications, for example changing food webs and community structure. © 2005 British Ecological Society. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645078385

Here, we present our results on the development of new techniques for large-scale kelp mariculture in Chile. We have abandoned the traditional technique of direct spore seeding onto inoculation lines. Instead, we used gametophyte cultures that were manipulated to enter gametogenesis and to produce synchronous batches of 104-10 5 embryos.

Between 80 and 102 days PS, L5 teeth appeared on the radula and there were fewer lateral serrations, consistent with the adult form of the animal, suggesting that this development is in preparation for feeding on macroalgae. Digestive gland complexity (tubule number and density) increased between 80 and 102 days PS and is consistent with greater enzyme production and increased digestive efficiency. Of the enzymes studied, laminarinase and lipase exhibited the highest activities in animals fed a diatom diet, both significantly increasing with age of the abalone. High laminarinase activities reflect higher utilisation of the algal polysaccharide chrysolaminarin in the diatom diet. Ingestion of artificial diet had no adverse effects on the morphological development of the digestive system, but trypsin activity in abalone fed the artificial diet was significantly higher than diatom-fed abalone of similar age, indicative of higher levels of protein in the artificial diet. Similarly, lipase activity was significantly lower in abalone fed the artificial diet and may reflect an inability to digest the fish oil component, which is not found in their natural diet. Future development of artificial diets, especially for juvenile abalone, should focus on the levels and type of lipid provided. Runt abalone (i.e. under-developed compared to their siblings) had radulae similar to much younger 80 days PS abalone and digestive tissue degradation at 137 days PS is evidence that runts have limited ability to ingest food and are nutritionally compromised. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Since macroalgae can absorb nutrients and increase the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), and can be ultimately removed from water by being harvested, macroalga-based bioremediation of eutrophication would be the best way to solve such environmental problems. The effects of Gracilaria lemaneaformis remediated eutrophication were studied. G. lemaneaformis, red seaweed, originated in Shandong Province, was cultivated on ropes in three typical mariculture areas at Dongshan island, Fujian province where mariculture is advanced. The mesocosm experiment was conducted in Bachimen fish-cage area; the bioremediation experiment - in a field about 3 hm 2 in Xipu bay where the shrimp-farm and urban sewage is discharged; and in the spread application experiment, about 400 hm2 were tested in Wujiao bay where abalone sewage is discharged. Water quality parameters were monitored during all the experimental stages. According to different tide and depth of the sea, two floating-rafts, i. e. bamboo raft and string raft, were devised to cultivate G. lemaneaformis on ropes in sea. The results demonstrated that the effects of bioremediation of eutrophication of mariculture waters by G. lemaneaformis were obvious regardless to the place of experiment: in mesocosm one, in a small-scale's bioremediation or in large area's spread application. The results of mesocosm experiments showed that G. lemaneaformis increased DO from low concentration to supersaturation and increased DO saturation from about 60% to 200%; in meantime, it absorbed the inorganic nitrogen (IN) and inorganic phosphorus (IP) above 80% during 3-4 days. In bioremediation area in Xipu bay, the specific growth rate of G. lemaneaformis was 9% during the first month and 6% during the next half month. The DO concentration in bioremediation area was significantly higher than that in non-bioremediation area: the highest DO concentration in bioremediation area was 5.6 mg·L-1 higher than that in non-bioremediation area in the same monitoring transect, the highest DO saturation was 198.7%. Furthermore, it increased the DO concentration of downstream seawater. And the IN and IP concentrations in bioremediation area were lower than those in non-bioremediation area. Besides, the microaglae were restrained, the concentration of Chlorophyll-a in bioremediation area was lower than that in non-bioremediation area, whereas, the transparence was contrary. In spread application area, when the abalone cultural sewage went through G. lemaneaformis cultural areas, the nitrogen and phosphorus were effectively absorbed. Especially, the IP concentration of abalone cultural sewage discharging area was above 0.05mg·L-1, however, that in G. lemaneaformis cultural areas was below 0.015mg·L-1. The DO concentration was increased in G. lemaneaformis cultural areas, its saturation was above 120%, the highest one was 166%, but, in non-cultural areas, the DO saturation was about 100% normally. In conclusion, by large farming of G. lemaneaformis in animal maricultural areas, it is possible to alleviate the pollution of marine environment, prevent from eutrophication and control the red tide. At the same time, because G. lemaneaformis was the ideal food for abalone and material to produce agar, it could resolve the problems of the local abalone culture. Hence, large farming of G. lemaneaformis in the eutrophic mariculture areas could reduce environmental impact and increase economic output, and good environmental and economic advantages would be obtained. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-28944438915

This study identifies issues to be considered by stakeholders in developing certification standards for channel catfish, tilapias, rainbow trout, oysters, mussels, clams, scallops, abalone, and seaweed. Common issues include land and water use, water pollution, benthic effects, effects on biodiversity, use of antibiotics and other chemicals, and relationships with workers and local communities. Specific, contentious issues apply to individual species or species groups. Fish meal use in feeds will be a major concern in finfish certification. Use of groundwater, removal of daily mortalities, and medicated feed in channel catfish culture should be given particular attention. Tilapia culture can introduce these species into watersheds where they have not previously occurred, resulting in serious competition with native species. Some environmentalists and consumers object to hormone treatment of tilapia to produce all male fry. Widespread use of therapeutic agents in trout culture will be a major concern. Discussions of shellfish certification should focus on water use conflicts and public health risks associated with the consumption of these organisms. The introduction of non-native species and genetic alterations with respect to oysters also will need to be addressed. Further, introduction of non-native species should be a major topic in discussions of abalone and seaweed culture. The source of wild seaweed to use as food in abalone culture also will be an issue.

We couple a first-order two-compartment bioaccumulation model and a reconstructed dose-response profile based on a three-parameter Hill equation model associated with a field bioaccumulation study to form a probabilistic model to determine acute and chronic EQC. The acute EQC (a-EQC) is predicted from IECs and a field-derived bioaccumulation factors, whereas a statistical procedure with an acute-to-chronic value is used to derive chronic EQC (c-EQC) based on bioaccumulation. Field bioaccumulation study demonstrates a linear relationship between water and tissue Zn concentrations in abalone and algae. Our model, designed for simplicity and theoretical insight, yields explicit mathematical results through a probabilistic analysis to capture EQC modeling methodology in a more realistic way by analyzing computationally through Monte Carlo simulations. Here we show that the median a-EQC ranges from 0.34-0.39 μg ml- 1, whereas the median c-EQC is 0.04-0.05 μg ml - 1 for selected abalone farms.

The identification of dimethyl arsenoriboses (phosphate, sulfonate, and glycerol) in both dominant macroalgae species, and especially digestive tissues of marine animals that consume them, suggests these arsenic species, are to some degree accumulated directly from their diets without degradation or conversion. An unknown arsenic species in H. rubra intestinal tissue was identified using tandem mass spectrometry as 2′,3′-dihydroxypropyl 5-deoxy-5-trimethyl arsonioriboside (trimethyl glycerol arsenoribose). The concentration of trimethyl glycerol arsenoribose in H. rubra intestinal tissue was estimated to account for 28% (5.0 μg g-1 dry mass) of the methanol-water-soluble arsenic fraction. The presence of a trimethyl glycerol arsenoribose in marine animal tissues may be due to microbial-mediated processes that promote the reduction and methylation of dimethyl arsenoriboses released during the breakdown of macroalgae in their diets. Arsenobetaine formation may then occur in the lumen of the digestive tract (i.e., mediated by microorganisms) or in the liver catalyzed by enzymes. The identification of a large amount of trimethyl glycerol arsenoribose in H. rubra intestinal tissue suggests this species is a main constituent in the pathway for arsenic in this marine animal. © 2005 American Chemical Society. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-23844518986

Seaweeds were reared in a biofiltration unit with fishpond waste water effluents. The three algal species were found to contain high protein contents which would be related to its production under the high nitrogen culture conditions of the biofilter system. Protein and carbohydrate contents were highest in H. musciformis and lowest in G. cornea. Survival rates of juvenile abalone were very good, regardless of the algae fed. Feed intake of H. spinella was highest, followed by H. musciformis. Growth rates of abalone were within the range obtained under commercial conditions, final shell length and weight being significantly highest in animals fed H. spinella and lowest in those fed G. cornea. Feeding G. cornea lead to the lowest growth performance due to the lowest feed intake, whereas feed conversion ratios were significantly highest for H. musciformis and protein efficiency ratios were higher for both H. spinella and G. cornea. This study suggested the good potential of any of the three red seaweeds tested-successfully produced by the biofilter system, their nutritional composition being similar to other macroalgae used as feed for abalone and matching the abalone protein and lipid requirements-hence promoting growth and survival. Nevertheless, the biofilter produced macroalgae H. spinella showed the highest dietary value for juvenile of H. tuberculata coccinea. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In these systems fish is cultured next to other organisms, which are converting otherwise discharged nutrients into valuable products. These conversions are analyzed based on nitrogen and phosphorous balances using a mass balance approach. The analytical concept of this review comprises a hypothetical system design with five modules: (1) the conversion of feed nutrients into fish biomass, the ""Fish-Biomass- Converter""; (2) the separation of solid and dissolved fish waste/nutrients; the ""Fish-Waste-Processor""; (3) the conversion of dissolved fish waste/nutrients, the ""Phototrophic-herbivore-Converter""; (4 and 5) the conversion of solid fish waste, the ""Bacterial-Waste-Converter"", or the ""Detrivorous-Converter"". In the reviewed examples, fish culture alone retains 20-50% feed nitrogen (N) and 15-65% feed phosphorous (P). The combination of fish culture with phototrophic conversion increases nutrient retention of feed N by 15-50% and feed P by up to 53%. If in addition herbivore consumption is included, nutrient retention decreases by 60-85% feed N and 50-90% feed P. This is according to the general observation of nutrient losses from one trophic level to the next. The conversion of nutrients into bacteria and detrivorous worm biomass contributes only in smaller margins (e.g. 7% feed N and 6% feed P and 0.06% feed N 0.03 × 10-3% feed P, respectively). All integrated modules have their specific limitations, which are related to uptake kinetics, nutrient preference, unwanted conversion processes and abiotic factors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, catches have been declining, probably caused by over harvesting and other factors. Understanding the effects of macroalgal type and water temperature on the consumption rates of tokobushi has applications for the management of its population such as to identify sites with appropriate quality and quantity of macroalgae and the favorable water temperature during stock enhancement. Under controlled conditions, the effects of macroalgal type and water temperature on the macroalgal consumption rates of tokobushi were evaluated. On a short-term basis (24-h feeding), consumption rates were higher on leathery brown algae (Sargassum fusiforme, Sargassum patens, Sargassum duplicatum, Sargassum alternato-pinnatum, Undaria pinnatifida and Laminaria japonica), corticated red algae (Acanthophora spicifera, Gracilaria gigas, Carpopeltis affinis and Ceramium sp.) and foliose green algae (Ulva pertusa and Enteromorpha intestinales) than on siphonous green algae (Codium spp.) and filamentous green algae (Chaetomorpha crassa and Cladophoropsis zollingeri). Averaged across 20 species of macroalgae, the mean consumption rate was 4.96 ± 0.27%wet-TW.d-1 (wet alga and wet abalone; TW = total weight) or 1.37 ± 0.19%dryTW.d-1 (dry alga and dry abalone). On a long-term basis (20 days feeding), tokobushi had higher consumption rates on the green alga Ulva pertusa and the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme than on the red alga Meristotheca papulosa. When presented with a choice of species (3 days feeding), tokobushi ate more of the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme and the red alga Gracilaria gigas than the green alga Codium cylindricum. Consumption rates generally increased with temperature. Generally, tokobushi prefer macroalgae with high percent dry weight composition, most of which are brown and red algae, and eat more at water temperatures around spring/fall (17°C, 21°C) and summer (27°C) in Kagoshima, Japan. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646096930

Larvae of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai were offered, in a petri dish, a choice of several food patches, each made of a diatom monoculture layer. The distribution of the larval settlement on the patches of 17 diatom species was determined. Nitzschia laevis induced the most abalone larvae settlement, followed by Navicula cf lenzii and Amphora luciae. The attractiveness of these diatoms for abalone larvae settlement was not directly related to algal biochemical composition or algal color. It is suggested that compounds excreted by algal cells determine their inductive properties for larval settlement. The larval chemosensory response depends on the concentration of these inductive substances. Sonicated diatom cell suspensions strongly induced larvae attachment, whereas dilute suspensions did not. Boiling settlement-inductive sonicated diatom cell suspensions did not affect their induction ability, implying that native proteins are not essential for the response. Aspartic acid was the only free amino acid excreted by two tested diatoms. It was also the only pure amino acid found inductive for larval settlement. It is therefore suggested that aspartic acid is a component of the settlement induction complex. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-4644324795

Two conditioning methods were evaluated comparing plates covered with U. lens grown over 4 and 18 days. An average settlement rate of 62% was estimated 3 days after larval release. This rate is amongst the highest recorded in commercial nurseries, suggesting that this technique of conditioning the settlement plates was efficient and reliable. Larvae showed a clear preference for older plates with a lower cover of U. lens. Larvae were released at two densities (50,000 and 100,000 larvae per 1000 l tank representing approximately 0.25 and 0.5 larvae cm-2 of substrate, respectively) to investigate if larval density influences overall settlement rate and later performance. Larval release density did not have a significant effect on settlement rate. After settlement, plates were randomised and the food density was enhanced. Half of the tanks were inoculated with the cultured diatom Navicula sp. and the other half received a mix of naturally developing diatom species, to determine the effect on growth and survival over a period of 4 months. We demonstrated that the type of substrate on which the larvae settled, light (which affects the food density but may also affect the oxygen level in the boundary layer of the biofilm) and the density of post-larvae have very marked effects on growth. Survival was strongly density-dependent after 64 days and the instant mortality rate (M) decreased from 43.7 in the first 10 days to 5.4 between 22 and 64 days after settlement. These results provide crucial technical and ecological information on the early development of H. rubra in the nursery and suggest that the use of U. lens will provide substantial improvements in nursery performance. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-2442488801

Brood stock abalone were induced to spawn by exposure to air for 2 h at 27°C. Female abalone spawned a mean of 76,530 eggs. Fertilised eggs measured 180 μm in diameter. Seventy percent survival was obtained during larval rearing. Larvae passed trochophore, veliger, gliding and creeping stages and were induced to settle on a mat of diatoms containing Nitszchia sp. and Navicula sp. The larval rearing period of H. varia ranged from 4 to 6 days at 27°C. The settled spat vigorously fed on the diatom mat until the 50th day of postfertilisation and coralline red algal film, until the 70th day of postfertilisation. First respiratory pore was formed on the 27th day of postfertilisation. Juvenile abalones were reared on three algal diets such as coralline red algae, green filamentous algae and Ulva lactuca from the 71st to 200th day of postfertilisation. Those fed with coralline algae showed best and consistent growth. Shell colour of juveniles was affected by diet.

We conducted a laboratory 14-day exposure experiment to obtain biokinetic parameters for soft tissue and shell of abalone and their food source, red alga Gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui. The physiological parameters in terms of growth rate constants for abalone and algae were derived from literature. The present AUC-based model demonstrates that depuration rate constants and growth rate constants of abalone and algae are the critical parameters in predicting relative bioavailable Zn to abalone. During uptake phase of the exposure experiment, estimated relative bioavailable Zn to soft tissue and shell of H. diversicolor supertexta were 71.04±9.71% (mean±standard deviation) and 68.44±8.29%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that relative bioavailable Zn to abalone is greatly affected by growth rate and depuration rate constants of abalone and is less dependent on algae growth rate. We also applied a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the impact of parameter uncertainty on relative bioavailable Zn predictions. Our results suggest that the probabilistic approach allows a range of possible outcomes and their likelihood; it better informs both aquacultural risk assessors and risk managers. Our study suggests that we have to take into account both biokinetic and physiological processes in predicting the relative bioavailable metals to aquatic animals. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This growth should use technologies with economical and environmental sustainability. Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms. As in certain traditional polyculture schemes, plants can drastically reduce feed use and environmental impact of industrialized mariculture and at the same time add to its income. These nutrient-assimilating photoautotrophic plants use solar energy to turn nutrient-rich effluents into profitable resources. Plants counteract the environmental effects of the heterotrophic fed fish and shrimp and restore water quality. Today's integrated intensive aquaculture approaches, developed from traditional extensive polyculture, integrate the culture of fish or shrimp with vegetables, microalgae, shellfish and/or seaweeds. Integrated mariculture can take place in coastal waters or in ponds and can be highly intensified. Today's technologies are well studied and documented. They are generic, modular and adaptable for several culture combinations of fish, shrimp, shellfish, abalone, sea urchin and several species of commercially important seaweeds and vegetables. A 1-ha land-based integrated seabream-shellfish-seaweed farm can produce 25 tons of fish, 50 tons of bivalves and 30 tons fresh weight of seaweeds annually. Another farm model can produce in 1 ha 55 tons of seabream or 92 tons of salmon, with 385 or 500 fresh weight of seaweed, respectively, without pollution. Preliminary calculations show a potential for high profitability with large integrated farms. Several freshwater integrated fish-vegetable farms and a couple of modern fish-algae-shellfish/abalone integrated mariculture farms exist today, and several additional farms are planned. Three major international R&D projects promise to soon expand the horizons of the technology further. Therefore, modern integrated systems in general, and seaweed-based systems in particular, are bound to play a major role in the sustainable expansion of world aquaculture. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The system is designed to allow artificial micro-particulate food to be sprayed (continuously until abalone are capable of feeding on seaweed) onto hard corrugate plastic plates, using agar as a fixative. Two trials were conducted to test substances that could be utilized to improve the settlement and metamorphosis rate of larval Haliotis discus discus when using the above experimental system. In trial 1, plates were sprayed with a mixture containing 1% agar and one of the following: natural diatom powder, Spirulina powder, Chlorella powder and two different concentrations of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), each with and without antibiotics. The negative control was a clean plastic plate without any additives and the positive control was plastic plates covered with a living natural diatom biofilm. There was no significant difference in the final metamorphosis rate of larvae induced to settle on the three micro-algal powders and the positive control (25.8-35.8%). However, these treatments had a significantly higher larval metamorphosis rate when compared to the negative control and the GABA treatments (1.7-7.5%). GABA did not induce metamorphosis of larvae at a significantly higher rate than the negative control, regardless of whether antibiotics were used or not. In trial 2, the effect of using both algal powders and mucus was tested to determine settlement and metamorphosis rates of larval abalone. Combining the effects of mucus and micro-algal powders or the positive control and mucus resulted in a final larval settlement rate of 80.8-89.2% and metamorphosis rate of 73.3-87.5%. This was significantly higher than the treatments that only incorporated micro-algal powder or the positive control, having an attachment rate of 20.8-41.7% and a total metamorphosis rate of only 3.3-28.3%. There is potential to use micro-algal powder as a substitute to living diatoms, to act as a settlement cue for larval H. discus discus.

A phenological study determined that tetrasporophytic fronds were fertile during the winter along the coast of northern France. This paper describes techniques for the induction of sporulation, for spore settlement and for incubation of germlings in 1.5-m-diameter tanks in semi-controlled conditions. The yield of released spores was in the range of 5000 to 25,000 g-1 of fertile sections. Mean spore density on substrate placed in hatching tanks was 500 spores cm -2.

A few days after spore inoculation, both male and female gametophytes had germinated and a male to female ratio of approximately 1:1 was observed. Female gametophytic discs remained microscopic whereas males developed gametophytic fronds. Growth of plantlets was well correlated with the concentration of medium supplements.

Increased commercial interest in these seaweed resources has been the stimulus for biodiversity studies. The Gracilariaceae (Rhodophyta) has emerged as one of the families that possess economic potential as a source of agar and as a potential feed for abalone. A lack of knowledge concerning the taxonomic status of many members of this family is a concern. Gross morphological characters have been the main means of identification and incorrect applications have led to a number of misidentifications. Consequently, a comprehensive reappraisal and revision of these species was carried out. The species count for the South African Gracilariaceae is now two Gracilariopsis species, and nine Gracilaria species. Gracilaria crassa has been reduced to a synonym of G. canaliculata. It is believed that G. foliifera was erroneously identified and specimens in South Africa referred to as G. millardetii and G. protea are assigned to G. corticata. South African Gracilariopsis, previously referred to as Gs. lemaneiformis, is confirmed to be conspecific with European Gs. longissima. This species occurs along the west and south coasts of South Africa, co-existing in a few habitats with G. gracilis. The taxonomic identity of G. vieillardii specimens from South Africa and the differentiation of G. canaliculata and G. salicornia has been confirmed based on morphology. Three species of Gracilaria (G. aculeata, G. beckeri and G. capensis) are endemic or near endemic to the South African coast, and a fourth species, G. denticulata is localised in southeast Africa. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-11244325769

Most individual abalone showed active feeding behavior, but there was considerable variation in growth of abalone between different algae and developmental stages of abalone. The growth rates of smaller post-larvae (0.4-1.2 mm SL) fed gametophytes and juvenile sporophytes of L. japonica, or A. longipes were significantly lower than those fed C. closterium. In contrast, juvenile sporophytes of L. japonica and A. longipes produced significantly faster growth in larger postlarval abalone (>1.8 mm SL) than gametophytes of L. japonica or C. closterium. Postlarvae in all developmental stages fed C. closterium actively grazed and efficiently ingested diatom cells. However, the relative dietary value of C. closterium decreased as abalone grew, probably because feeding efficiency on this diatom decreased because of its low cell volume and thin film-like colonies. Smaller post-larvae (0.4-1.2 mm SL) grazed repeatedly on the same surface of gametophytes, juvenile sporophytes of L. japonica, or on A. longipes without detaching these algae, whereas larger post-larvae (>1.8 mm SL) detached and ingested large amounts of whole cells of these algae. Postlarval abalone (>1.8 mm SL) began to use L. japonica gametophytes and juvenile sporophytes at approximately the same size at which morphologic changes occurred in their radulae, which enabled the ingestion of macroalgae. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3843103586

To the export demand has recently been added the new demand for high-quality Lessonia spp. as a foodstuff for the expanding abalone culture industry in Chile. The present study is based on efforts to produce significant quantities of Lessonia trabeculata in long-line culture as food for tank-cultured Haliotis rufescens Swainson and Haliotis discus-hannae Ino, which accept it as an excellent source of nutrition. Small sporophytes of L. trabeculata were propagated in the laboratory from reproductive blades harvested by diving near Coquimbo (30°S). The best culture substrate was polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in small pieces, inserted into the nylon cord for final culturing. Enrichment of sea water with agricultural-grade fertilizer produced no differences in growth and development of the Lessonia compared with results obtained using Provasoli medium. Sporophytes 1-2 cm in length cultured on 12-mm cord were transferred to outdoor tanks with circulating sea water and strong aeration where they were outgrown to 15-20 cm length; at this size, they were transferred to a 50-m long line in the ocean. In a 1-year period, individual plants reached up to 1.7 kg in mass, with average values per cord of about 9 kg. Total production from the long line was about 500 kg fresh weight of the alga.

An intensive, biofiltered recirculating integrated system producing fish and seaweed on a semi-commercial scale was evaluated with respect to production and to nutrient and heat budgets. The system consisted of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) tanks, an intensive fishpond (Sparus aurata), and a three-stage Ulva lactuca biofilter, which cleaned and recirculated 50% of the effluent back to the fishpond. To preserve water heat, the shellfish and fishpond units were both covered with greenhouses; the biofilter unit was covered with a greenhouse only during winter. Seaweed yield was variable and averaged 94 and 117 g m-2 day-1 (fresh weight) in periods with and without greenhouse cover, respectively. Protein content of U. lactuca averaged above 34% of dry weight. The biofiltration of only 50% of the water through the seaweed biofilter reduced the export of dissolved nutrients to the environment by nearly 30%. Peak ammonia excretion by the morning-fed fish coincided with maximum seaweed light-dependent ammonia uptake and concentrations of ammonia in the fishpond remained within nontoxic limits. Also, daytime photosynthesis of U. lactuca (uptake of CO<inf>2</inf>) met fish respiration (production of CO<inf>2</inf>), thus balancing fishpond pH levels within safe limits regarding ammonia toxicity. Daytime oxygen demand by the fish was partially met by the photosynthetically generated oxygen. Before covering the biofilter with a greenhouse, it lost much heat, reducing the temperature in the fishpond. Following the greenhouse covering of the biofilter, heat loss ceased and consequently the fishpond temperature was raised. Recirculation through the biofilter improved system sustainability; it reduced water use, lowered negative environmental impact, and maintained stable and safe water quality conditions in the fishpond. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Three qualitative conceptual models were developed and compared; the first and second ones assuming homogeneous and heterogeneous environmental conditions, respectively, and the third expanded one considering eco-social components under the assumption of environmental heterogeneity. For all these models, the factors described by Vásquez [Bot. Mar. 38 (1995) 251] were included in the management plan for the harvesting of brown macroalgae. Based on Levins's Loop Analysis, the system will have a just weakly unstable moving equilibrium if the harvesting activities do not negatively affect the macrophyta's reproduction and recruitment processes. Therefore, coincidence of reproduction and/or recruitment with harvesting must be avoided in a putative management plan. Regarding the qualitative predictions of the system's behaviour after negatively affecting reproduction and recruitment, only an ecological model assuming a heterogeneous environment shows realistic responses in comparison to experimental studies on the same species. This contribution is the first approach considering the dynamical behaviour of L. nigrescens and its surroundings. Nevertheless, further models, based on the same modelling theory, may integrate more variables from social and economical fields in order to improve the scope of this complex system. Further comparative studies should focus on the assessment of the significance of the structural functions of L. nigrescens and other macroalgae for the conservation of this benthic system. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Lanosol and other brominated aromatic compounds are prevalent among filamentous red algae frequently consumed by K. tunicata and have been shown to deter feeding in species of Haliotis. Animals were gavaged daily with 10 mg of lanosol per kg of wet mass for 3 days. Mean basal levels of estradiol and testosterone hydroxylase and glutathione transferase specific activities were higher in digestive gland tissue from H. rufescens relative to that of K. tunicata, and only K. tunicata glutathione transferase specific activity was affected by lanosol treatment.

Field observations showed that all juvenile abalone remained concealed under urchins by day. Even by night, only 10-25% left the protection of urchins to forage. Offered a choice of rocks or urchins in tide pools, the juveniles strongly preferred urchins rather than rocks. In aquaria, both urchins and abalone were active only at night. The frequency with which juvenile abalone left shelter was greatest if rocks constituted the only form of concealment, intermediate when they sheltered under urchins alone and least when the urchins had access to drift kelp. The treatment that provided abalone with both urchins and drift kelp had the lowest rate of urchin movement and the highest microalgal benthic standing stocks, the gut contents of the abalone comprised mainly kelp and their gut fullness indices were higher than in the other treatments. Concealment of juvenile abalone beneath urchins evidently provides them with several benefits. First, when urchins trap drift kelp, the abalone are capable of feeding on it and enhance their uptake of food. Second, this behaviour reduces the frequency with which juvenile abalone leave the shelter of urchins. Third, urchins that trap drift kelp reduce their rates of movement and their consumption of benthic microalgae, and we speculate that this may improve feeding conditions for the early postsettlement ""recruit"" stages of H. midae, and reduce the risk of Urchins ""bulldozing"" them. Thus, for a complex of reasons, the dependency of P. angulosus on drift kelp provides benefits to abalone that would not exist if this urchin acted as a conventional grazer. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

All strains were within the size range ingested by most filter feeders, i.e. 3-10 μm. Cellular growth rates of aerated 1.6-1 cultures ranged from 0.5-0.7 divisions·day-1 (Papiliocellulus simplex CS-431, Nitzschia cf paleacea CS-433) to 1.7-2.0 divisions·day-1 (Attheya septentrionalis CS-425, Entomoneis cf punctulata CS-426, Extubocellulus spinifera CS-428, Thalassiosira oceanica CS-427). The latter four strains were also rich in energy storage fractions (carbohydrate and/or lipid), especially as cultures progressed to stationary phase. Based on the initial screening, A. septentrionalis, E. cf punctulata, E. spinifera and T. oceanica were assessed as to their food value for juvenile Pacific oysters. The diatoms were fed as part of a mixed diet - each making up 70-83% of the total dry weight - together with an equal mixture of the haptophytes Pavlova lutheri and Isochrysis sp. (T. ISO) over a 21-day experiment. Diets containing A. septentrionalis and E. cf punctulata were the most effective, producing growth rates (k=0.050 day-1) marginally inferior to a similar (reference) diet containing a commonly used aquaculture diatom strain of high nutritional value, T. pseudonana CCMP 1335 (k=0.055 day-1). Regression analysis showed that oyster growth rate was correlated with the content of protein in the equal ration algal diets. We have shown A. septentrionalis and E. cf punctulata to be alternative Australian strains with good nutritional value that could be utilised by oyster hatcheries or nurseries. These strains, and others isolated in the study with different characteristics such as benthic growth or high protein levels, could also prove useful feed species for other animal species grown in aquaculture such as abalone and scallops. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

One of the obstacles to this harmonization is the negative economic relationship between developments and conservation. In order to sustain a systematic aquaculture, we need to establish benefits for both the human economy and the biological economy. The polyculture of Ulva and fish has been conducted by our group since 1964, with differing intents. Sakai was able to develop an abalone culture that fed on the Ulva cultured in the fish farm, and these mollusks produced green pearls as a byproduct of this fish culture. In that way, human profit was harmonized with the biological economy. The whole aqua-crop ensilage (WACE) system has been lectured by Hirata since 1999. The fish culture introduces nutrients into the sea. The nutrients contribute to the growth of sessile organisms. Whole organisms are harvested and ensilaged to produce the probiotic feed. This feed is mixed with routine fish feed. Ruminated culture will also be applied for byproducing the rotifer in culture of fish. These systems will be developed in the future. © 2002, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

The biokinetic parameters used in this study, uptake and depuration rate constants of abalone and their food source, red alga Gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui, were obtained from a laboratory 14-d exposure experiment. We carried out a sensitivity analysis of the model by using the fractional factorial design technique, taking into account the influence of consumer-resource-related parameters such as growth and death rates and biomass and biokinetic parameters characterized by bioconcentration factor. Results indicate that the response time of biomagnification dynamics of Zn accumulation in abalone was influenced mainly by the growth rate of algae and biomass and the death rate of abalone and by interactions algae biomass and abalone death rate and abalone and algae biomass. New algae production results in substantially higher values of biomagnification factor. The linked model was then applied to field observations from a real-life situation of variable Zn concentrations occurring in abalone farms. Simulation results show that the predicted values are within a factor of 2 of the measured values (% errors range from 5.3±4% to 44.1±8%). Both model analysis and model application to the abalone farms suggest that the linking influences between biokinetics and consumer-resource dynamics support Zn accumulation in H. diversicolor supertexta and in G. tenuistipitata var. liui as functions of Zn concentration in water and abundance of food occurring in abalone farms. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study estimates the biomass of E. maxima available for harvesting, investigates the effects of harvesting on the recovery of kelp and on the benthic understorey biota, and tests an alternative method of harvesting kelp by cutting off only fronds rather than whole plants. Estimates from diver sampling between May 1992 and November 1994 and infra-red maps indicate an E. maxima biomass at Danger Point of 22 973 tons fresh mass in 336 ha of kelp beds, insufficient to sustain projected abalone feed requirements in the area if harvesting is done in the traditional manner of cutting the stipes. However, sufficient frond material may be harvested sustainably if only fronds are cut, at distances 20-30 cm from the bases of fronds. Cutting at 10 cm from the base significantly reduced regrowth rates, and there was little regrowth after cutting at 2 cm. Yield per unit effort was higher for a four-month interval between harvesting them for one-, two- and three-month intervals. Two years after harvesting whole plants (in two 100 × 20 m lanes), biomass and density of kelp had recovered (similar in control and harvested lanes), and there were no detectable differences in the understorey communities, as measured by detrended correspondence analysis. Although harvesting of whole kelp has a minimal effect on the understorey biota and kelp itself recovers within two years, selective cutting of fronds allows plants to remains alive and produce a higher yield. This method is likely to minimize damage to the kelp bed system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036355237

A feeding trial was designed to cover a full reproductive cycle in young adult green abalone, Haliotis fulgens, consisting of five diet treatments: the macrophytic algal phaeophyte Egregia menziesii, rhodophyte Chondracanthus canaliculatus, chlorophyte Ulva lobata, a composite of the three algae and a starvation control. The lipid class, fatty acid, sterol and 1-O-alkyl glyceryl ether profiles were determined for foot, hepatopancreas/gonad tissues and larvae. The major fatty acids were 16:0, 18:0, 18:1(n-7)c, 18:1(n-9)c, 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3) and 22:5(n-3), as well as 14:0 for abalone fed brown and red algae. 4,8,12-Trimethyltridecanoic acid, derived from algae, was detected for the first time in H. fulgens (hepatopancreas complex, 1.2-13.9%; larvae, 0.5% of total fatty acids). Diacylglyceryl ethers were present in larvae (0.6% of total lipid). The major 1-O-alkyl glycerols were 16:0, 16:1 and 18:0. Additionally, 18:1(n-9) was a major component in hepatopancreas/gonad and larvae. The major sterol was cholesterol (96-100% of total sterols). Highest growth rates were linked to temperature and occurred in abalone fed the phaeophyte E. menziesii (43 μm·day-1, 56 mg·day-1 yearly mean), an alga containing the highest levels of C<inf>20</inf> polyunsaturated fatty acids and the highest ratio of 20:4(n-6) to 20:5(n-3). This study provides evidence of the influence of diet and temperature on seasonal changes in abalone lipid profiles, where diet is most strongly related to body mass and temperature to shell length. The allocation of lipids to specific tissues in green abalone clarifies their lipid metabolism.

We addressed all these topics by exploring interactions between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and both recruits and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, in the light of the fact that juvenile abalone shelter beneath the urchins. In field experiments at six sites, urchins were eliminated from removal plots to determine the degree to which juvenile abalone (individuals 3-35 mm in length) depend upon urchins. Comparisons were made with undisturbed and disturbance-control plots. We hypothesized that after removal of urchins: (1) there would be an immediate decline of juvenile abalone, since they are intimately associated with the urchins; (2) abalone recruits (recent settlers < 3 mm in length) would be unlikely to suffer immediately or directly because, unlike juveniles, they are only weakly associated with the urchins; (3) foliar algae would proliferate due to decreased grazing by urchins; (4) there would be a consequent reduction in crustose coralline algae due to overgrowth by foliar algae; and (5) the decline of crustose corallines would reduce recruitment of abalone due to a loss of settlement and nursery habitat. In urchin-removal plots, juvenile abalone declined dramatically, becoming virtually extinct locally. Their disappearance was slowest in crevices compared with exposed habitats, but even there they failed to survive longer than five months. Contrary to expectations, abalone recruits also disappeared from urchin-removal plots, possibly because the cover of sediment almost doubled there. Also contrary to our hypotheses, neither foliar macroalgae nor encrusting corallines responded to urchin removal. The explanation of these results is that P. angulosus was able to gather drift kelp when this food source was available, rather than acting as an active grazer. This feeding pattern has profound consequences and explains why urchins failed to influence algal community composition. By sheltering beneath urchins, juvenile abalone gain protection from predators and may also benefit from an enhanced food supply. Bottom-up subsidization of urchins by drift kelp is thus responsible for the feeding behavior of the urchins, and indirectly facilitates their role in harboring juvenile abalone. This role is of immense importance for the lucrative abalone fishery, and depletion of urchins could lead to a collapse of abalone populations. Human exploitation of top predators that consume urchins, such as rock lobsters and some fishes, has conceivably exaggerated the role of urchins in sustaining juvenile abalone. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036165218

This may have been caused by an interference with the cell volume regulatory mechanisms normally utilized by Haliotis spp. Enrichment of wild U. rigida increased the algal protein content from 11.4 ± 2% (dry weight) to 32.2 ± 1.5%, perhaps partially explaining the difference in performance between this and other abalone feed trials utilizing Ulva spp. Results indicate that enriched U. rigida is a suitable feed for H. roei, providing similar growth to that achieved from several commercially available diets. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

However, in a commercial situation, adult abalone (Haliotis iris) caught for broodstock or pearling, show reluctance to start feeding on stationary artificial food. If they cannot be induced to feed, they may lapse into a starvation phase that can last several weeks. Subtidal adult H. iris (125 mm shell length) were collected during autumn, winter, spring, and summer from Banks Peninsula, Canterbury and held at Pendarves Abalone Farm Ltd. (South Island, New Zealand). Abalone were divided randomly into two groups. One group was offered a commercial pellet diet together with small quantities (0.03-0.05g dry weight L-1) of suspended seaweed particles (Gracilaria spp.) to test its potential as a tactile phagostimulant. The other group (nonstimulant control) were supplied with the same commercial diet without the algal stimulant Each group consisted of three replicate vessels containing three individuals. Abalone behavioral responses and ingestion rates were monitored in both groups over a 3-wk period. Abalone in the stimulant experiment exhibited a typical feeding posture almost immediately, were more alert, and engaged in a greater range of feeding activities than the abalone that had been supplied with commercial food only. Those abalone without access to the algal stimulant remained either quiescent or alert in most seasons. Feeding activity of abalone in the stimulant treatment was significantly higher (P < 0.05) as compared with abalone from the nonstimulant control for all seasons except winter. Also, abalone consumed significantly more artificial food when tactile stimulants were present during autumn and winter. However, ingestion rates seemed highly sensitive to both season and acclimation time. Within each season, there was a consistent trend of increasing ingestion rate during the third week of the experiment, and this was most discernible in the stimulant treatment. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

Red abalones and red sea urchins also support important fisheries. Here we explore spatial interactions and apparent competitive effects among these species at an area where fishing has large impacts on both taxa, and at unfished reserve sites in which invertebrate density and food availability differ. There was an inverse correlation between adult red abalone and red sea urchin abundance at the scale of our transects when density of either or both species was high. In the poorest habitat for macroalgae, red abalones seldom occurred on the same transects with red urchins. The results suggest that differences in density, depth, and food availability play an important role in the observed spatial patterns of red abalones and red sea urchins. Purple sea urchins were not correlated to either of the other two species' distributions. An intense fishery for red sea urchins appears to have had a positive effect on kelp availability, and abalone growth and abundance. Aerial photographs during the period of intense urchin fishing (from 1982 to 1989), showed a dramatic increase in the surface canopy. Similarly, during this period, size frequency distributions of fished red abalones show an increase in the number of individuals in larger size classes. Modal progression in abalone size frequency distributions suggests a faster growth rate during this period when compared with a growth study, at the same location, conducted during the pre-urchin fishery years. Ultimately, red sea urchin removal apparently led to an increase in red abalone abundance even at a site that was heavily fished by recreational abalone fishers. Meanwhile, at a nearby reserve site where kelp populations are lower, red abalones have declined in abundance as red sea urchins increased. Our results suggest the need for multi-species ecosystem-based approaches to management of these valuable resources. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

The radula of competent larvae contained 11-13 transverse rows of teeth after 6-7 days at 20°C. The number of rows increased to 25-30 during the first several days after settlement, but then remained approximately constant throughout the post-larval period, increasing again in abalone larger than 4 mm in shell length (SL). In post-larvae <∼1 mm SL, only two pairs of lateral teeth (L1, L2) were present in the larval radula. An additional three pairs of lateral teeth (L3-L5) were added progressively as post-larvae grew from 0.9 mm to 1.9 mm SL. Marginal teeth were added steadily from one pair in larvae to 30-40 pairs at 3-4 mm SL, 70-80 pairs in 30-40 mm juveniles, and 70-90 pairs in 90-100 mm adults. The serrations on the working edges of the rachidian (R) and lateral teeth became less pronounced as the abalone grew. Nearly all serrations disappeared from the rachidian (R) and inner lateral teeth (L1, L2) by ∼2 mm SL, and from the outer lateral teeth (L3-L5) by 20 mm SL. For abalone larger than 1.5 mm SL, the L3-L5 teeth became longer and more pointed, which increased the space between adjacent rows of teeth. Post-larvae < 1 mm SL had highly curved teeth with clearance angles of approximately or less than zero, whereas larger abalone had positive clearance angles. These radula developments appear to be related to transitions in feeding habits from microbial to macroalgal diets. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034840053

Abalone (Haliotis iris) larvae were deprived of metamorphosis cues and the effects of delayed metamorphosis on larval competence, and post-larval growth and survival were quantified. Larvae were exposed to a metamorphosis inducer (the coralline alga Phymatolithon repandum (Foslie) Wilks and Woelkerling) on Days 11, 18, 22, 26, 30 and 34 post-fertilisation (temperature 16-17°C). Post-larvae were reared on diatoms (Nitzschia longissima Grunow) for 3-4 weeks post-metamorphosis. Delayed metamorphosis caused progressive negative effects on post-larval performance. Virtually all larvae initiated metamorphosis in response to P. repandum, regardless of larval age. The proportion of post-larvae that developed post-larval shell growth within 2 days of metamorphosis induction dropped only ∼ 20% from Day 11 to Day 26 (P > 0.05), but was significantly lower by Day 30 and Day 34 (P < 0.001). Larvae that metamorphosed on Days 11, 18 and 22 showed high survival (>80%) and growth rates (means of 20-22 μm shell length per day). In contrast, larvae that metamorphosed on Day 26 and Day 30 had poor survival (30-40%) and lower (P < 0.05) growth rates (15-16 μm/day). Of the larvae that metamorphosed on Day 34, only 7 (30%) survived their first week post-metamorphosis, and they grew only 2 μm/day on average. Only one of these post-larvae (4%) survived the second week. The visible yolk supply diminished over the life of the larvae and was near zero by Day 34. Nearly all larvae had died by Day 38. H. iris larvae remained competent to metamorphose for at least 3 weeks after they attained competence. Post-larval growth and survival were not reduced if metamorphosis occurred within 3 weeks of fertilisation. This extended period of larval competence implies that H. iris larvae can potentially disperse for up to several weeks before successful metamorphosis. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035970933

In all the cases, we isolated several strains of the genus Nitzschia and one strain of Amphiprora paludosa var. hyalina. Monospecific and non-axenic cultures of each strain were maintained on batch cultures under white and blue light at high (150 μE m-2 s-1) photon fluence rates. For all the diatoms we observed that the growth rate (μ) in the second or third day of culture had high values of duplicated strains per day. We compared the growth rate of these strains with a control specie Navicula incerta, a strain used as food in several abalone farms in México, and found similar growth rates in some of the cases. For each strain, a covariance analysis was used to compare growth using white versus blue light wavelength. No significant differences in growth were observed between the two light conditions. We obtained high growth rate for Amphiprora paludosa var. hyalina with almost double values of those obtained with of the control species N. incerta and the others strains: N. thermalis var. minor, N. fonticola var. pelagica and N. frustulum var. perminuta. The sub-strains of N. laevis exhibit equal growth rate and nearly 50% less than that of N. incerta.

The goals were to achieve nutrient recycling, reduced water use, reduced nutrient discharge and high yields. Effluents from Japanese abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) culture tanks drained into a pellet-fed fish (Sparus aurata) culture tank. The fish effluent drained into macroalgal (Ulva lactuca or Gracilaria conferta) culture, and biofilter tanks. Algal production fed the abalone. The system was monitored to assess productivity and nitrogen partitioning over a year. The fish grew at 0.67% day-1, yielding 28-kg m-2 year-1. The nutrients excreted by the fish supported high yields of U. lactuca (78-kg m-2 year-1) and efficient (80%) ammonia filtration. Gracilaria functioned poorly. Ulva supported an abalone growth rate of 0.9% day-1 and a length increase of 40-66 μm day-1 in juveniles, and 0.34% day-1 and 59 μm day-1 in young adults. Total abalone yield was 9.4 kg year-1.

Prior to closure, harvests of the main species that compose the fishery (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens Swainson 1822; the green abalone, Haliotis fulgens Philippi 1845; and the pink abalone, Haliotis corrugata Gray 1828) had plummeted to an all-time low of several hundred thousand pounds per year. Overfishing and several diseases identified recently in abalone are creating concern within the industry with respect to the recovery of the fishery. One method being considered to restore the fishery on a limited basis is reseeding. Reseeding success is dependent on many factors, including planting location and techniques of seed placement. Other important factors include the abundance and nutritive quality of macroalgae (kelp) available to the abalone, the seawater temperature requirement of the species being seeded, the size of the seed being planted, and the presence of potential predators within the seed site. In this study, we observed that shell growth and weight gain in juvenile red and green abalone are temperature-dependent. When constant, elevated temperatures are maintained, growth rates improved as compared to growth rates in animals kept at the lower temperatures normally found. More growth in juvenile red abalone was observed at 19 °C, with an average daily shell growth of 0.1 mm/day. Previous work suggested that Egregia laevigata, a brown kelp was a superior food source for juvenile abalone; however, the growth rates of red abalone fed Egregia increased minimally compared to growth rates of juvenile red abalone fed another brown kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Maximum sustained shell growth of 0.16 mm/day in juvenile green abalone was observed at a culture temperature of 21 °C. Extrapolations of these growth rates for an entire year indicate growth of 36 mm/y for red abalone and 60 mm/y for green abalone. Growth predictions based on laboratory-reared juveniles will vary from those observed in wild populations since seawater temperatures are not static along the coast and may vary as much as 10-12 °C during the year. The nutritional value of kelp and other algae may be as important as temperature in the effect on growth observed in the laboratory and in the field. Increased growth rates exhibited by juvenile red abalone during the period from January through April 1977 may be reflective of changing nutrient ratios or levels in kelp that are otherwise limiting during reduced or non-upwelling months. We are presently culturing hatchery-produced red and green abalone seed for eventual planting in the U.S. Department of the Interior's Cabrillo National Monument. The seed are approximately 45 mm in size and are fed a mixed kelp diet. They will be transplanted when they are approximately 75-100 mm in size. Reseeding success assessed by annual dive surveys should help determine if planting larger animals increases survival of brood stock and increases recruitment within the monument area. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

Rates of dulse production, dulse consumption by abalone, ammonia uptake by dulse and ammonia excretion by abalone were measured seasonally over 1 year. Abalone growth rates under co-culture conditions were measured. Maximum abalone stocking densities within the co-culture system were first limited by the amount of algae available for abalone consumption, and then by the capacity of the algae to absorb ammonia excreted by abalone. Degree of supplemental illumination, water volume exchange rate, and abalone body weight all affected maximum stocking densities within the co-culture system.

Settlement was very low on single species diatom films and varied between 1%-6%. Depending on the species combination larvae preferred to settle on films with mixed diatom species than single species films. The highest settlement was achieved with a mixed film of Navicula sp. and Amphora sp. Five and ten-day-old germlings of Sporolithon durum induced settlement of the abalone Haliotis rubra. However, the settlement rate was significantly lower on germlings than on the whole thallus of the alga. Germlings inoculated with the diatom Navicula sp. induced higher settlement than films of the diatom species alone. High settlement of up to 52% was also achieved with germlings of the green alga Ulvella lens. Settlement was reduced on U. lens squares inoculated with the diatom Navicula sp. but higher than on films of the diatom alone. The settlement rate was higher if plates with U. lens were previously grazed by juvenile abalone. Post-larval growth rates were higher on monospecific diatom films than on U. lens or on S. durum. The best growth rate was obtained with Navicula sp. U. lens and S. durum are both good settlement inducers, but are not sufficient to support rapid growth of young H. rubra post-larvae. Survival was low on U. lens and on the diatom C. closterium. We suggest that commercial nursery plates seeded with U. lens will result in high and consistent settlement, while an inoculum with Navicula sp. will ensure sufficient food for rapid growth of the post-larvae. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033737084

A total of 100 families was produced from a hierarchical mating design using 29 males and 88 females. Larvae from each family were settled and grown in separate tanks until tagged at the age of 10 months, at which time individuals from all families were reared in one common environment, but at two farms, until the age of 24 months. After tagging, the abalone were fed with the macro algae species Palmaria palmata and Laminaria digitata. The mean survival rate of the population was estimated at 9.6% at the age of 4 months, with large variation among families where the highest survival was 31.5% but the lowest 0.02%. The average shell length at the age of 8, 10, 18, and 24 months old was 13.10, 15.88, 34.99, and 50.90 mm, respectively. Heritability for survival at 4 months of age was estimated to 0.11 (0.33 on the liability scale) and for shell length at the age of 8, 10, 18, and 24 months to 0.08, 0.06, 0.27, and 0.34, respectively. A low, but negative, genetic correlation between the survival rate to 4 months and shell length was observed.

The discovery that Porphyra improves growth of South African abalone (Haliotis midae) farmed in land-based tanks has led to increased pressure to harvest wild populations. This paper reports on a survey of the distribution and seasonality of Porphyra in the southern Western Cape. Porphyra was present at all sites surveyed, and showed considerable temporal variation. A significant amount of the Porphyra present is in reserves and therefore protected from harvesting. Closer examination of one site revealed seasonal populations of Porphyra that occupied different niches dependent on season. Recruitment peaked in spring and autumn, leading to dense summer and winter populations. Summer populations generally grew lower in the eulittoral than winter populations. No pattern in the mortality of larger thalli was detected, though sporeling mortality was high following recruitment peaks. Although it seems that most sites in the southern Western Cape are suitable for harvesting, the taxonomy of the genus in the region urgently needs revision if populations are to be appropriately managed. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

The number of settled larvae was significantly greater on Sporolithon durum than on two other species of NCA (Mesophyllum engelhartii and Hydrolithon rupestre) co-occurring in the habitat. Settlement on Sporolithon durum commenced immediately after competent larvae were added. When offered a choice between two growth-forms of S. durum, larvae initially preferred the more complex lumpy growth-form to the encrusting growth-form, but this result was not significant after 48 h. This indicates that surface characteristics of the species influence settlement of Haliotis laevigata, but are not the main factors. When the algal thallus was damaged, the number of settled larvae was greater on damaged than on undamaged pieces of Sporolithon durum and Mesophyllum engelhartii, but less on damaged pieces than on undamaged pieces of Hydrolithon rupestre. Settlement on Sporolithon durum was also significantly greater when the photosynthetic pigments in the outermost cells of the thallus were present. These results indicate that inducers of settlement are highly variable and dependent on both the NCA species and species-specific characteristics. No larvae settled on the bottom or sides of the jars, suggesting that the inducers of settlement may not be soluble in water after their release from the algal thalli. Alternatively, inducers are not released in a large enough concentration, even when the algal thallus has been damaged. We conclude that the inducers are algal in origin. Larvae of the abalone Haliotis laevigata do not settle gregariously in response to recently-settled conspecific larvae.

Like other tropical haliotids, H. asinina prefers red algae to brown algal species. Eighteen algal species, 72.2% of which are red algae (Rhodophyta), were observed in the gut contents of all size groups of abalone; Laurencia, Hypnea, Amphiroa and Coelothrix are the most frequent food species. Hypnea and Laurencia are also the most abundant food items of H. asinina. A chi-square test indicated that frequency of occurrence (%) of most algal food species in the gut samples is independent of the size of the animal. About 84% of all algal species were observed in the gut contents of small abalone. Haliotis asinina (mean shell length ± SD = 3.48 ± 0.05 cm) showed a distinct nocturnal feeding periodicity and remained cryptic during daylight hours. Feeding activity was intense from 1800 to 0200 h, but it slowed down a few hours before sunrise, resulting in about 11 h of feeding time within a 24-h cycle. Defecation occurred during the feeding period in proportion to the amount of food consumed and faecal production during the night was significantly higher than during the daylight hours. The total daily faecal output was 1.26 mg dry weight abalone-1.

Enzyme activity was not detected on Day 7 (0.52 ± 0.01 mm SL, mean ± standard error) but by Day 17 (0.97 ± 0.02 mm SL), there was detectable activity from all enzymes. This indicates that a suite of enzymes for brown algal feeding is produced even by the postlarval stage. Changes in the total activity of CMCase, alginate lyase, and laminarinase showed a pattern similar to the growth rate, with a rapid increase observed after Day 37 (1.59 ± 0.04 mm SL). However, specific activities did not show the marked changes evident in the total activities, suggesting that the rapid increase of total activities observed after Day 37 was mainly caused by increased production of digestive enzyme with growth. Despite the negligible contents of cellulose and alginate in food of postlarvae, Days 37 and 46 postlarvae showed strong enzyme activity against these polysaccharides, suggesting that the appearance of enzyme activity during postlarval development does not require the presence of a substrate. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

Visceral FAA levels were examined at 0, 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 36, 44, 52, 62, 72, and 96 h after a meal. The mean level of free essential amino acids (FEAA) attained an obvious peak at 4 h.

Abalone larvae settle on coralline algae, some diatoms films, and conspecific mucous trails. These substrata provide a wide range of potential food sources, which are used in different ways as postlarvae develop. We identify three major transitions in feeding and growth: (1) at metamorphosis, a shift from lecithotrophy/dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption to particle feeding, with an overlap in nutrition sources; (2) at about 600-800 μm shell length (SL), postlarvae become responsive to the 'digestibility' of diatom diets and grow more rapidly on efficiently digested strains; (3) at around 5-10 mm SL juveniles shift from a biofilm-dominated diet to a macroalgae-dominated diet. We can make some tentative generalizations about growth rates of postlarvae fed ingestible diatoms. Rapid growth (20-30 μm/day) in the first 10 days postsettlement often falls to 10-20 μm/day in the following 1-2 wk, perhaps reflecting the exhaustion of nutrition from yolk/DOM. Postlarvae of 0.8-2 mm SL grow ~ 40-60 μm/day on 'digestible' diatoms and 15-30 μm/day on 'indigestible' ones. Rapidly growing juveniles over 3 mm SL will grow at 100 μm/day or more, whereas poor diets can halve these growth rates. Growth rates of individual abalone will vary widely on both good and poor diets. Diatoms that are emerging as key species for abalone culture include Cylindrotheca closterium (and needle-shaped Nitzschia spp.), Cocconeis spp., and Achnanthes spp., but caution is needed in extrapolating from the limited data available. Hatcheries need to maintain a suitable quantity of ingestible food, as well as consider food quality. Many aspects of postlarval feeding and growth require further research. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam. All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032434878

Six rotation diets and six single-species control diets were tested simultaneously over a 6-mo period.

Because of this feeding preference, the structure of the digestive tract of H. laevigata was investigated using histological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The digestive tract of both starved and fed adult H. laevigata revealed the presence of ciliated, mucus, and secretory cells throughout the digestive tract. The esophagus contained secretory, ciliated, and large mucous cells, with fragmentation spherules also present. The crop extended from the esophagus to the stomach. It was surrounded by thin muscularis and consisted mainly of secretory cells, although some phagocytes were present. The stomach possessed mainly secretory cells, although some ciliated cells, mucous cells, and phagocytes were present. The style sac differed from the stomach, having more ciliated cells. In intestinal regions I to III, the epithelium was shorter than in previous regions. Few cilia were present on the ridges, although many were observed in the gutters. Intestinal regions IV to V contained more mucous cells than intestine III, and more bacteria were observed associated with the fecal string than in other regions. The low incidence of bacterial association with the gut epithelium was attributed to the occurrence and number of mucous cells, common throughout the digestive tract. Spherical bodies present in the lumen are believed to be fragmentation spherules involved in waste removal and enzyme release. Starved abalone contained fewer mucous cells in the esophagus, had less pronounced staining reactions in the stomach, contained large amounts of granular inclusions in the style sac, and had fewer phagocytes in the intestines. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

The system was the first and simplest trial in a series of progressive complexity of the concept of integrated culture of seaweed, abalone, fish and clams in modular and intensive land-based facilities. Relative sizes of the modules, their stocking densities and the rate of nutrient supply were determined based on earlier results to be optimal. Effluents from two abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) culture tanks drained into macroalgae (Ulva lactuca or Gracilaria conferta) culture and biofilter tanks, where nitrogenous waste products contributed to the nutrition of the algae; net algal production from each algal tank was harvested and used to provide a mixed diet for the abalone. Excess algal yield was used elsewhere. The system was monitored to assess productivity and nitrogen partitioning over a year, while improvements were made based on the accumulating results. Total annual N-budgets were combined with mean production figures to determine a suitable ratio of abalone biomass to algal culture vessel productivity, towards commercial application of the concept. The abalone grew on average 0.26% and 0.25% body weight/d in the two culture tanks; reduced growth and increased food conversion ratios (food eaten/biomass gain; w/w) were associated with high summer water temperatures (max. 26.9°C).

Eighteen days after settlement, post-larval abalone started to graze on the diatom Cocconeis scutellum leaving the bottom valves of the diatoms on the surface of P. repandum. As a result, the diatom population decreased markedly. The outermost cells and polysaccharide layer of P. repandum were often missing but we did not find any grazing marks on the thallus surface up to 53 days post-settlement. We discuss the hypothesis that epithallial cell sloughing of non-geniculate coralline red algae is an intrinsic mechanism to reduce microscopic epiphytes and may interact closely with grazing by post-larval abalone. We concluded that the post-larvae must find an additional food source derived from the NCA before grazing on the diatoms, because of the high growth-rate during the first and second week of rearing and the constancy throughout the experiment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001003407

The end point and the timing of the settlement process varied, depending on the cue provided. Response was qualitatively consistent between experiments, but showed some quantitative variation. Rocks coated with crustose coralline algae (CCA) induced 80-100% of larvae to attach and metamorphose, and 50-100% to grow peristomal shell, within 2 days. A distilled water extract of CCA induced almost 100% attachment within 2 days, but metamorphosis occurred gradually between 2 and 5 days. Shell growth was minimal, apparently inhibited by chemical interference from the extract. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA, 1 μM) induced 90-100% attachment and 20-60% metamorphosis in H. iris within 2 days. For H. virginea, 1 μM GABA induced attachment (65-100%) but typically only 0-5% metamorphosis within 2 days. KC1 (10 mM) added to seawater induced attachment (50-70%) but less than 10% metamorphosis. Different diatoms induced responses ranging from rapid or gradual induction of metamorphosis, to minimal response. Some combinations of cues produced synergistic effects. E.g., GABA (1 μM) plus diatom biofilm induced more metamorphosis (49%) than biofilm (28%) or GABA (1%) alone. Addition of CCA crude extract to the same biofilm hastened metamorphosis. Observations of attachment without subsequent metamorphosis suggest that there may be separate cues for attachment and metamorphosis. This study highlights the complexity of the settlement response in abalone. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000526477

Experiments were performed for 5 weeks with two groups of different developmental stage, newly metamorphosed stage (younger post-larvae) and over 1 mm stage (older post-larvae). Both stages of post-larvae reared on CCA + diatoms grew well (53.4 ± 2.4 μm/day; mean ± SE and 85.0 ± 4.0 μm/day; mean ± SE, respectively). Younger post-larvae grew to over 2 mm in 5 weeks, and older ones reached over 4 mm in 5 weeks. There was no difference in shell length of younger post-larvae reared on CCA + diatom and CCA - diatom at the week 1. However, the mean growth rate of abalone on CCA - diatoms from the second to fifth week (24.4 ± 1.9 μm/day; mean ± SE) was significantly lower than that of individuals on CCA + diatoms and the younger post-larvae on CCA - diatoms reached only 1 mm shell length in 5 weeks. The older post-larvae also did not grow well (27.8 ± 3.3 μm/day; mean ± SE) on CCA -diatoms and did not reach 3 mm by the end of the experiment. On CCA + diatoms, 74.6 ± 2.0% (mean ± SE) of the younger post-larvae survived for the 5 weeks experiment. In contrast, the survival rate of the younger post-larvae reared on CCA - diatoms decreased rapidly until the second week, and 25.0 ± 12.6% (mean ± SE) of the individuals survived by the fifth week. The results of this study indicate that diatoms are essential for the rapid growth of post-larval abalone on the CCA.

Outbreaks connected with fish vectors were caused by scombroid, ciguatoxin, bacteria and unknown agents; in shellfish, unknown agents, paralytic shellfish poisoning, Vibrio spp. and other bacteria, followed by hepatitis A virus, were responsible for the outbreaks. At least ten genera of bacterial pathogens have been implicated in seafood-borne diseases. Over the past twenty-five years, bacterial pathogens associated with faecal contamination have represented only 4% of the shellfish-associated outbreaks, while naturally-occurring bacteria accounted for 20% of shellfish-related illnesses and 99% of the deaths. Most of these indigenous bacteria fall into the family Vibrionaceae which includes the genera Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas. In general, Vibrio spp. are not associated with faecal contamination and therefore faecal indicators do not correlate with the presence of Vibrio. Viruses are the most significant cause of shellfish-associated disease: in New York State, for example, 33% and 62% of 196 outbreaks between 1981 and 1992 were caused by Norwalk virus and gastrointestinal viruses (small round structured viruses), respectively. In addition, several illnesses are a result of toxic algal blooms, the growth of naturally occurring bacteria and diatoms causing neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning and ciguatera. Current estimates place the annual number of ciguatera cases at 20,000 world-wide. Scombroid poisoning is the most significant cause of illness associated with seafood. Scombrotoxin is of bacterial origin and halophilic Vibrio spp. causing high histamine levels are implicated as the source. Scombroid poisoning is geographically diverse and many species have been implicated, namely: tuna, mahi-mahi, bluefish, sardines, mackerel, amberjack and abalone. Temperature abuse has been cited as a major cause of scombroid poisoning. For routine work, the use of faecal indicators to predict the relative level of faecal contamination should not be disposed of. However, the main source of seafood illness is due to species which are not predicted by these organisms. In order to protect public health, routine surveillance using new pathogen-specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction should be used. This, in combination with risk assessment methods and hazard analysis and critical control points, will begin to address the need for improvement in the safety of seafood.

Grazing rates for rhodophytes, Gracilaria sp. and Hymenocladia sanguinea exceeded those on phaeophytes, Macrocystis pyrifera and Lessonia variegata.

Although high water temperatures (25-27 C) inhibited summer growth, and in spite of the high salinity (41 ± 1 ppt), four groups of abalone of different sizes grew more in 1 yr than reported in their natural habitat. This fast growth is attributed to the long period (8 mo, from fall to spring) in which temperatures in Eilat waters are within the optimal range for this species, and to the high protein content of the seaweed. Winter timing of maximal growth as well as reproduction in Eilat was reversed compared with Europe, where they occur in summer.

Fatty acid analysis revealed that C<inf>18</inf> and C<inf>20</inf> PUFA, such as 18:4n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3, were dominant in the brown algae, A. esculenta, L. digitata and L. saccharina. The red alga, P. palmata, was characterised by the highest proportion of 20:5n-3 among the selected algae. In the green alga, U. lactuca, however, the dominant PUFA were C<inf>16</inf> and C<inf>18</inf> fatty acids, while C<inf>20</inf> fatty acids were minimal. All the selected algae consistently contained very low levels of C<inf>22</inf> fatty acids. Statistical analyses demonstrated that (a) 20:5n-3 played a prominent role in the nutrition of both abalone species; (b) 18:3n-3 as well as other n-3 PUFA, and 18:2n-6 together with other n-3,6 long-chained PUFA also contributed to the faster growth of H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively. The results suggest that the PUFA of both n-3 and n-6 families seem to be essential for growth of H. discus hannai; for H. tuberculata, however, growth enhancement appeared to depend largely on n-3 PUFA. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

(Gastropoda: Haliotidae) were assessed in the hatchery. Animals were held in cages deployed in a flowtray with recirculating seawater maintained at 18 ± 2 °C, and fed ad libitum on the red alga Palmaria palmata (L.) Kuntze. In the grading experiment juvenile abalone were divided into four populations consisting of small (mean ± s.e; initial shell length = 15.3 ± 0.15 mm; n = 35), medium (initial shell length = 19.6 ± 0.16 mm; n = 35), large (initial shell length = 23.8 ± 0.17 mm; n = 35) and an ungraded control group (16.8 ± 0.41 mm; n = 35). Rearing was carried out over a period of 226 days, after which it could be concluded that an advantage in overall growth performance had been gained by grading the animals. There was evidence that growth of small abalone improved in the absence of larger conspecifics. In the stocking density experiment with two size grades and three stocking densities, a decreasing exponential relationship was found between growth (body weight and shell length) and stocking density, with a substantial amount of growth occurring at all densities. Final total biomass for both grades of abalone increased with density. For the smaller grade biomass gain increased as density increased. However, for the larger grade biomass gain declined at higher density. Overall mean survival (± s.e) was 98.3 ± 0.4% and was not influenced by density. It is suggested that the choice of stocking density is essentially a trade-off between maximum growth, optimal biomass gain, and economic considerations which may dictate densities that would result in a net reduction in overall production costs. © 1995. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029538642

These digestibilities, in conjunction with total intakes, were used to estimate the daily intakes of nitrogen and energy of abalone feeding on those algal species used by Fleming (1995). These were then used to explain the growth rates, intakes and chemosensory preferences of abalone in that study. The chemosensory preferences of abalone were strongly related to the digestible nitrogen content of the algae and to a slightly lesser extent the nitrogen content of the algae, indicating the important role nitrogen plays in setting preferences in this abalone. The intakes of digestible nitrogen were significantly related to the growth rates of abalone, suggesting that nitrogen is a limiting nutrient to abalone growth. Thus, H. rubra selects those foods which maximise the intake of nitrogen and result in maximum growth rates. Energy does not appear to play a major role in setting abalone preference as the digestible energy contents of algae in this study (and in general) are similar and did not correlate with preference. The digestible nitrogen content was lowest in the 3 brown algae tested and digestibility was related to the polyphenolic content of the brown algae. This suggests that the low growth of H. rubra on these species results from the action of polyphenolic compounds, reducing nitrogen digestibility. © 1995. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028814447

The 6 diets of single species tested were the red algae Jeannerettia lobata and Laurencia botryoides, the green alga Ulva australis, and the brown algae Macrocystis angustifolia,Phyllospora comosa and Ecklonia radiata. The greatest growth rate and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) for a single algal diet was with J. lobata (51.0 mg · day -1, 4.0% wet weight). The highest intake was of P. comosa (4.1% body weight), but this did not result in a high growth rate (0.8 mg · day-1). Neither intake nor FCE were correlated with growth rate, suggesting that these measures are not good indicators of the nutritional value of a food item. The hierarchy of food preference of H. rubra was determined for the 6 test diets of single species based on chemosensory attractiveness, involving direct tactile and gustatory sampling. Abalone exhibited distinct preferences, the most preferred being J. lobata and the least preferred the phenolic-rich E. radiata. The hierarchy of chemosensory preference for the algae tested was related to the growth rate of abalone when feeding on these algae. Thus, preference appears to be under selective pressure to ensure that abalone select foods that are nutritionally valuable, resulting in optimum growth rates. However, the low-phenolic brown algae, M. angustifolia and P. comosa, were less preferred than L. botryoides, despite the negative growth and mortality of animals feeding on this alga. © 1995. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028993581

GABA was not detectable in extracts of crustose red algae (CRA) which are the preferred settlement substratum for Haliotis larvae. The CRA surfaces and their associated biofilms did not produce GABA from glutamate, and GABA production from putrescine required gabaculine (transaminase inhibitor). The GABA-degrading activity on the CRA surfaces was removed by surface-sterilisation. It ranged from 0.45 to 1.12 nmol cm-2 h-1 with insignificant seasonal variation. Removal of grazing molluscs from CRA-covered stones led to the growth of a visible biofilm and markedly increased GABA degradation in 2 weeks. Within a few days of placing clean, sterile glass surfaces in the settlement environment, biofilms with GABA-degrading activity developed, and after 11 weeks incubation the GABA degradation rate on glass marbles was 0.37 nmol cm-2 h-1. GABA was not completely oxidised, and the products of GABA metabolism showed similar chromatographic behaviour to alanine and glutamate. In the typical New Zealand Haliotis settlement habitat, GABA is not likely to play a significant role as an inducer of abalone larval settlement because on the preferred settlement surfaces it is not readily produced from its precursors but it is easily degraded. © 1995. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028984580

The amino acid compositions of 6 species of macroalgae (Ulva lactuca, Chondrus crispus, Palmaria palmata, Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria saccharina) and of the whole soft body of these abalone were determined and compared. The effects of these algal diets on the free amino acid (FAA) profiles in the viscera and muscle of animals were investigated. To find a suitable index to evaluate the protein quality of natural diets for algivores, several indices were computed and correlated to the growth performance of abalone using correlation analysis. These two species of abalone have a very similar amino acid composition, indicating that they may have similar amino acid requirements. In all the selected algae, arginine may be the limiting amino acid, and in some instances methionine, threonine or histidine may be also limiting. Judging from the results of feeding test and amino acid analysis, P. palmata and A. esculenta seem to have the better amino acid pattern and availability among the selected algae. On the other hand, U. lactuca and C. crispus appear to be poor in their amino acid availability and/or pattern. Dietary treatments significantly affected the FAA profiles in animal tissues. The essential amino acid index (EAAI) and the degree of similarity (DS) of EAA patterns may not be applicable to evaluating the nutritional value of protein in natural feeds for the algivorous molluscs. Among the indices examined, the newly proposed index-balance and adequacy of free EAA in viscera (BAEAAv)-seems to be suitable for estimation of protein quality of natural feeds for abalone, because it takes into account the balance, adequacy and availability of EAA in natural diets. © 1994. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028249985

Lead concentrations in shell material gradually decreased also, from 150 ppb to 82 ppb in the oldest specimen. The decrease of concentration in tissues with increasing age indicates that a mechanism for exclusion of lead during tissue growth becomes more efficient with age. Along the food chain in which abalone is the final stage, lead was enriched at the first stage, from seawater to algae, by a factor of 100. Lead was diminished at all subsequent stages of the chain.

Culture conditions and algal growth influenced protoplast yields: old cultures and slowly growing parts, such as cells of the main axis, produced few protoplasts. In contrast, cell walls of meristematic regions were easily digested. Protoplasts regenerated cell walls within a few days, and after 6-7 weeks the resulting mature plants were identical with their donor specimens. Regenerates from the normal gametophytes developed mature gametangia, whereas those from the virus-infected gametophytes produced pathological symptoms upon maturity. Gametangia or infection symptoms frequently occurred very early and before the regenerates established new filaments (neoteny). In contrast to zoids, protoplasts were not infected by freshly released virus particles.

Abalone (Haliotis roei) and several species of limpets and chitons are abundant in the barren zone, which is generally devoid of non‐coralline macroalgae. The relative importance of abalone versus limpets and chitons in limiting macroalgal abundance in the barren zone was evaluated by manipulating the presence of each group in a factorial experiment. Percentage algal cover was measured photographically in 0.25m2 plots at 1–2 month intervals for 9 months. Mean algal cover (mainly the foliose green alga, Ulva rigida) was highest in plots where all grazers were excluded (77–99%), intermediate where only limpets and chitons were excluded (37–85%), and lowest where only abalone were excluded (4–30%) or where no grazers were excluded (2–19%). The effect of limpets and chitons accounted for 55–89% of the variance in total algal cover, whereas the effect of abalone generally accounted for <10% of the variance. Similar results were obtained in terms of the biomass of Ulva rigida at the end of the experiment. Haliotis roei are relatively large and sedentary herbivores, feeding mainly on drift algae. Their effect on algal abundance was mediated both through pre‐emption of space, which might otherwise be colonized by algae, and by grazing around their home scar. Limpets and chitons are smaller than abalone, but were much more abundant. Intensive grazing of the reef surface by limpets and chitons precluded the establishment of non‐coralline macroalgae, even where abalone were absent. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Abalone consumed three phenolic-poor algal species, Laminaria sinclarii (Harvey) Farlow, Macrocystis pyrifera Agardh, and Nereocystis luetkeana Postels et Ruprecht (mean phenolic content = 0.52% dry mass), at a greater rate than two phenolic-rich species, Dictyoneurum californicum Ruprecht and Cystoseira osmundacea Agardh (mean phenolic content = 4.60% dry mass). This inverse relationship between phenolic content and consumption rate also existed after the algae were macerated and the liquid portion of the blended slurry incorporated in agar discs. However, the correlation between grazing rate and phenolic content imprpve d in this latter experiment, thus suggesting that abalone grazing was deterred significantly by the morphology of L. sinclarii and, to a lesser extent, of M. pyrifera. Polyphenolics extracted from D. californicum reduced abalone grazing rates by 90% when incorporated into agar discs at a concentration of 6 mg·ml-1.

The abalone ate less of the phenol-containing discs than of the discs lacking phenolics. Our results support findings of several prior studies that polyphenolic compounds from brown algae deter grazing by coastal zone herbivores in the northeast Pacific Ocean. © 1992. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026496727

It was concluded that Spirulina mixed feed makes a good substitute for live microalgae in the cultivation of parent scallops. Spirulina mixed feed proved to be useful for the normal development of the scallop gonads, thereby achieving a higher fecundity and hatchery rate. Thus, the use of Spirulina mixed feed enhanced production of the Bay Scallop by giving them an advantage of about one month in the season, Also, mixed feed greatly simplified the feeding procedure, avoiding the change of temperature which would normally result from pouring large quantities of live microalgae into the production tanks.

There is usually only 1 limpet per shell, although 2 or 3 limpets occasionally co-occur. A strong positive relationship in size (shell length) between Patelloida nigrosulcata and H. roei indicates that limpets settle on juvenile abalone and grow at a rate proportional to the growth rate of their host. A similar size relationship exists between Patelloida nigrosulcata and Patella laticostata.

Energy losses in the form of ammonia excretion are negligible, accounting for less than 1% of consumption. Some 5% of energy intake, or 13% of absorbed ration (Ab) is thus available for growth and reproductive output (Pg & Pr). In juveniles (<100mm) this is all allocated towards somatic growth, while in adults an increasing proportion of production is expended on reproductive output.

M. integrifolia was completely removed from one plot, partially removed from one plot, and left undisturbed in a control plot. At the end of the study period, the relative abundance of the brown alga Desmarestia ligulata and the green alga Ulva sp. had increased in the harvested plots relative to the control plot. Harvesting, and the resulting changes in understory plant composition, were reflected in the relative abundances of drifting plant fragments available to herbivores. In harvested areas, brown algal fragments other than M. integrifolia (mostly D. ligulata) dominated during the winter; whereas in the unharvested site M. integrifolia dominated the fragment pool throughout the year. None of the herbivores studied (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, S. droebachiensis, Parastichopus californicus, and Haliotis kamtschatkana) decreased their density in response to harvesting. Gonadal indices of the two sea urchins were lower in the harvested areas, which indicated that these grazers were less well fed. We conclude that removal of M. integrifolia altered the abundance of both understory plants and drifting fragments.

To help achieve such improvements, modern methods of biochemical and genetic engineering can be adapted to control biological processes which intrinsically limit the efficiency and yield of molluscan production. Critical life-cycle stages of several species of abalones and other commercially valuable molluscs which thus far have proved amenable to improved control by these means include reproduction, larval settlement, metamorphosis, and acceleration of early growth. Analysis of the physiological and molecular mechanisms that control reproduction in molluscs reveals a prostaglandin-dependent regulation of spawning in abalones and certain other species. Spawning of gravid adults can be induced by the addition of prostaglandins to the surrounding seawater, or, more reliably and inexpensively, by activation of the endogenous enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandin-related spawning triggers in response to added hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide activation of the prostaglandin-dependent spawning reaction has been found widely useful for obtaining synchronous and copious release of fully competent gametes in a large number of species of abalones, oysters, scallops, mussels, clams, and other valuable molluses; a number of these species had not been successfully spawned by other methods. Settlement and metamorphosis of many species can be brought under similar biochemical control. The efficient induction of settlement and metamorphosis of the larvae of many Haliotis (abalone) species normally requires contact with any of several crustose red algae usually associated with natural recruiting substrates. This requirement can be met by providing competent larvae with the essential algae or with specific proteins purified from these algae, although production of these inducers is both time consuming and costly. Most conveniently and inexpensively, this natural requirement can be met by providing the larvae with certain unique amino acid constituents normally associated with the inducing proteins. Thus, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can be used simply, safely, and inexpensively to induce complete and rapid larval settlement and metamorphosis - with minimal mortality - in many commercially important abalone species. This and similar neurotransmitter-related, amino acid-derived compounds are proving comparably effective for the reliable induction of settlement and metamorphosis in a number of other valuable molluscan species. Recent analyses of the requirements for rapid early juvenile growth in abalones reveals a mechanism of growth control which is susceptible to exogenous hormonal acceleration. Present experiments aimed at genetic cloning and amplification of recombinant-DNA templates for the essential growth-regulating hormones, progress in the establishment of useful molluscan gene banks, and potential uses of this technology for molluscan aquaculture are described. © 1984. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001489541

The habitat, movement, feeding behaviour, food, and ecological relationships with predators were studied for each species at three study sites. Each species of abalone occupies a distinctive microhabitat. H. cyclobates lives in calm-water places associated with communities of the seagrass Posidonia australis and the razor shell Pinna dolobrata; H. laevigata lives on open rock adjacent to sand in moderate to rough water localities; H. ruber prefers caves in calm- to rough-water localities; H. roei occurs in narrow crevices in the upper sublittoral on rough-water coasts; H. scalaris is an under-boulder or crevice-living species. All species are sedentary, but may make local movements in search of food. Several species may occur in a given habitat but there is little microhabitat overlap. The seasonal variation in food eaten by each species is described. All species show preference for red algae and reject most species of brown algae, subsisting predominantly on red algae and seagrasses according to the possibilities of the habitat. H. laevigata feeds mainly on algal drift and H. roei is substantially a grazing species. The other species feed on algal drift or graze opportunistically. Water movement is an important environmental factor affecting the feeding of those species which feed on algal drift. H. laevigata and H. ruber feed best in conditions of moderate water movement but poorly if the water is too calm or too rough. Water movement elicits a characteristic feeding response in these species. The predators of abalone include fish, crabs, molluscs, and starfish; their interaction with abalone is discussed. Crevices, caves, and cavities under boulders provide a refuge in space from predators for H. roei, H. ruber, and H. scalaris and juveniles of other species, which appear to be confined to these places, except for nocturnal feeding excursions, by the activity of their predators. The adults of the different species differ from each other in their dependence on water movement, their preference for open or cryptic sites such as crevices or caves for resting, their size and their methods of feeding. These differences between the species, taken together, ensure that there will be very little overlap between them in the sorts of places that they seek to live in or their behaviour in seeking food; in those cases where food-seeking behaviour is similar, interspecific competition would seem to be negligible because food is abundant. Predation would seem to have been more important than interspecific competition as the selective pressure that established and maintains these differences between the species. © 1973 CSIRO.

Examination of gut contents of H. iris and H. australis from Kaikoura on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand indicated that both species fed mainly on red algae at all times of the year. Feeding was greatest in the winter. H. iris from Taylors Mistake, 154 km south, fed almost exclusively on the brown alga Macrocystis pyrifera. By comparing these results with analyses of the floral composition of attached and drift algae in the two areas it was shown that food at Kaikoura was derived from drift algae washed in to shore from deeper water and at Taylors Mistake from attached seaweed. Laboratory selection experiments showed that both species preferred the red alga Hymenocladia lanceolata to either of the brown algae Lessonia variegata or Macrocystis pyrifera. H. australis was more selective than H. iris from Kaikoura. Juvenile H. iris fed in the laboratory for six months on a monospecific diet of Hymenocladia grew faster than those fed on Lessonia. It is suggested that H. iris at Kaikoura, a generally sedentary species found on flat boulder bottoms or on low rocky ridges, receives an almost continuous supply of drift seaweed and is therefore not very selective in its diet. H. australis, on the other hand, inhabits crevices but, being an active browser on attached and drift seaweed, is able to be more selective. H. iris from Taylors Mistake is an active feeder due to the limited amount of food available at this locality. Floral composition is the major factor controlling the diet of the abalones but selection has an important role for H. australis at one locality. © 1977 Taylor & Francis Ltd. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000833863

These movements may vary from year to year depending on sea conditions. Tn contrast, subtidal colonies dispersed more gradually, seemingly disturbed by the tagging operation and subsequent rehandling. Other colonies which were not tagged remained apparently unchanged for up to 2 years. Individuals in subtidal H. australis Gmelin colonies also did not move to any great extent over this period: this species inhabits narrow crevices and appears to be a much more active animal than H. iris, both in the field and in the laboratory. Drift and attached algae were virtually absent from the crevices inhabited by H. australis and it seems likely that the species must forage to feed. A homing mechanism may be present because many older H. australis are found in deep scars on the rocks or have characteristically worn shell edges fitting the rock of their particular site. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Ltd. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000833862

Extracellular enzymes were found in the digestive fluid. Absorption in the digestive gland was demonstrated by autoradiography of tissue sections after feeding animals on 14C‐labeled algae. After absorption, food was retained apically in the absorptive cells of the digestive gland in an insoluble form. Possible mechanisms of uptake are discussed. It was shown chromatographically that small compounds derived from the food were present in both the crop fluid and blood early in digestion. Studies in vitro showed that the crop epithelium was permeable to small organic materials. Glucose and phenylalanine were found to have been taken up by the crop epithelium in considerable quantities; smaller amounts were passed through the epithelium, and would in life be transferred to the blood. The surface area of the food mass was seen to be increased in an intestinal sorting area at the beginning of the intestine. The intestinal epithelium was shown in vitro to be permeable to glucose. It is concluded that the large crop is an important region of absorption, and that digestion and absorption continue to occur as food passes along the intestine.

Fresh mussel (Mytilus sp.) was preferred to all other foods tried in feeding experiments. The animals were fed every second day on opened mussels, and occasionally on fresh fish. The juveniles “grazed” actively on the calcareous algae (Corallina officinalis L.) present on the rocks. The animals were extremely sensitive to pollution. To reduce pollution risks all sediments were removed from each tank, as the interstices between them were found to harbour uneaten food particles. Any uneaten foods were siphoned out every second day and each tank was thoroughly cleaned every six to eight weeks.

The results are as follows: (1) The annual fluctuation in the growth of the abalone is considered to be no significant correlation with the environmental factors such as the temperature and salinity of water. (2) The said fluctuation shows a high correlation with the amount of catch of sea-weed. Especially, it is recognized that it has a significant and positive correlation with the amount of catch of Undaria pinnatifida, a brown sea-weed favorite food for abalone, as shown in Table 8. (3) The annual fluctuation in the amount of catch of the abalone is parallel to that of the growth of the abalone. (4) It has already been reported by the author1) that U. pinnatifida and Laminaria are the most suitable food for H. discus hannai. Presuming from these facts, it is easily conceivable that the production of abalones is influenced by the production of sea-weed, especially by that of the brown-algae such as U. pinnatifida or Laminaria.

Generally speaking, when a mixed food is given to abalones, their growth are inferior to the growth of abalone, fed with algae which are superior as food. 5) It has been assumed that the optimum temperature for the growth of H. discus hannai is within the range of 15~20°C. 6) The efficiency of food conversion at the water temperature of 10 °C has been found to be 5~8% (12-21% in calorie equivalence) for abalones of 20~30g in weight fed with Undaria pinnatifida and 9~11% (24~29 cal. %) for ones of 60~90g in weight, and the case fed with Paehymenia sp. shows 8~13% (7 –11 cal. %) and 22~31% (20~28 cal. %) respectively, and in either case large sized abalones have shown higher rates, but the rates secured the stability at least between 50~100g in body weight. 7) For maintaining the body weight of abalones, necessary daily rates of feeding with U. pinnatifida are 1.75% (0.42% in calorie equivalence) and 0.65% (0.15 cal. %) respectively, for the ones of 20~30g and the ones of 60~90g in weight, and in the case fed with Pachy-menia sp. 0.82% (0.53 cal. %) and 0.08% (0.05 cal. %) respectively. These rates are smaller for the larger sized abalones. 8) The relation between the species of food and the maturation of gonad of abalones is in exact conformity with the relation between the species of food and the growth rate of abalones, and the food suitable for the growth of the shell also brings a good result to the maturation of gonad. 9) No significant difference in the chemical composition of the meat of abalones due to. © 1962, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

In this respect the author (1962) experimentally proved that the abalones fed with brown algae grow faster than those given green or red algae, and their shell bears bluish-green color. He (1958) also reported that correlation exists between annual harvests of the abalones and their favorite food, Undaria pinnatifida, a brown seaweed. The present work was undertaken to evaluate various localities around the Bay for propagation of the abalone by observing the ratio of the bluish-green area to the whole shell surface of the sample specimens and algal vegetation in these areas (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The survey indicated that 1) the annual harvest of U. pinnatifida per kilometer of the coast line was different from place to place (Fig. 1); 2) where the brown alga was more abundant, the abalone grew faster with the bluish-green shell area being larger, than in specimens from the other localities (Fig. 2); 3) even among the specimens from the same seaweed ground, those which had a higher ratio of the bluish-green area grew faster than the others (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that in a locality where U. pinnatifida is flourish, the abalone ottener eats this seaweed, grows faster, and comes to bear the bluish-green shell area at a higher ratio. In other words, the shell complexion of the abalone from a locality may reveal, to some extent, whether or not the locality is suitable for propagation of the univalve. © 1962, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Nutritional value of algal diets can be divided into three categories for each species of abalone. For H. tuberculata the best performance was on the mixed diet and Palmaria palmata intermediate was Alaria esculenta, Ulva lactuca and Laminaria digitata, and lowest growth was on Laminaria saccharina and Chondrus crispus. For H. discus hannai, best performance was on A. esculenta, P. palmata and the mixed diet; intermediate was on L. saccharina and L. digitata and lowest was on U. lactuca. It is generally accepted that high ''balanced'' levels of protein (> 15%), lipid (3-5%) and carbohydrate (20-30%), with no detrimental substances in natural algae are essential for optimal growth performance of these abalone. The fact that A. esculenta, L. saccharina and U. lactuca had different dietary values for the two abalone species indicates specific nutritive requirements and/or digestive physiology. Overall, H. tuberculata grew faster, had higher food conversion efficiencies and muscle yield than H. discus hannai.

The current study confirmed our previous findings. Based on SGR the dietary values of these macroalgae can be listed in a decreasing order as follows: P. palmata, A. esculenta, U. lactuca, L. digitata and L. saccharina for H. tuberculata and, A. esculenta, P. palmata, L. digitata, L. saccharina and LI. lactuca for H. discus hannai. Fatty acid analysis revealed that C-18 and C-20 PUFA, such as 18:4n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3, were dominant in the brown algae, A. esculenta, L. digitata and L. saccharina. The red alga, P. palmata, was characterised by the highest proportion of 20:5n-3 among the selected algae. In the green alga, Li. lactuca, however, the dominant PUFA were C-16 and C-18 fatty acids, while C-20 fatty acids were minimal. All the selected algae consistently contained very low levels of C-22 fatty acids. Statistical analyses demonstrated that (a) 20:5n-3 played a prominent role in the nutrition of both abalone species; (b) 18:3n-3 as well as other n-3 PUFA, and 18:2n-6 together with other n-3,6 long-chained PUFA also contributed to the faster growth of H. tuberculata and H. discus hannai, respectively.

Evidence of environmentally induced changes were not found for condition indices relating shell and soft body proportions; muscle composition, such as total protein, collagen or water content; muscle biochemistry, such as intracellular pH buffering capacity, adenylate content, homarine or inositol monophosphate (IMP) content; blood hemocyanin concentration and muscle RNA content indicative of protein synthesis and somatic growth rates. The major difference in muscles of animals from exposed sites were higher activities of the glycolytic pyruvate reductase enzyme, tauropine dehydrogenase, and lower glycogen content. The differences imply that abalone exposed to heavy wave action routinely depend on bouts of anaerobic muscle work associated with attachment and locomotion but that the absence of wave action in aquacultural practice may not adversely affect muscle properties.

However, their performance poses a dilemma: TAN (Total Ammonia N) uptake rate - and with it seaweed yield and protein content - is inversely proportional to TAN uptake efficiency. The ideal for a seaweed biofilter performance would be a high uptake rate together with high uptake efficiency. The novel three-stage seaweed biofilter design described here has solved this dilemma. The design used the finding that the performance of seaweed ponds depended on the flux of TAN through them, and that therefore effluents with reduced TAN concentration could provide the seaweed with a high TAN flux if the water flow increased proportionally. Effluents from a seabream fishpond were passed through a series of three successively smaller (25, 12.5 and 6.25 m(2), respectively) air-agitated Ulva lactuca ponds. The diminished inflow TAN concentrations to the second and third ponds of the biofilter system were compensated for by the increased water exchange rates, inversely proportional to their sizes. The biofilter performance was evaluated under several TAN loads. TAN was efficiently removed (85 - 90%), at a high areal rate (up to 2.9 g N m(-2) d(-1)) while producing high protein U. lactuca (up to 44% dw) in all three stages, although with mediocre yields (up to 189 g fresh m(-2) d(-1)).

The effects of these algal diets on the free amino acid (FAA) profiles inthe viscera and muscle of animals were investigated. To find a suitable index to evaluate the protein quality of natural diets for algivores, several indices were computed and correlated to the growth performance of abalone using correlation analysis. These two species of abalone have a very similar amino acid composition, indicating that they may have similar amino acid requirements. In all the selected algae, arginine may be the limiting amino acid, and in some instances methionine, threonine or histidine may be also limiting. Judging from the results of feeding test and amino acid analysis, P. palmata and A. esculenta seem to have the better amino acid pattern and availability among the selected algae.

All 3 spp. grew during the experiment but H. rufescens had the lowest efficiency (10.2%) and H. fulgens had the highest efficiency (22.7%). These differences might be due to the temperature regime (16-23.degree. C) during the experiment.

This is a particular concern for aquaculture industries due to the economic impacts of such events. Diets containing algal supplements have been suggested as pre-emptive solutions for preventing these mass mortalities. The same has also been suggested for diets containing grape seed extract. This is due to their potential as a source of antioxidative compounds, which reduce the accumulation of harmful reactive oxygen species. This study aimed to identify functional genes associated with high survival in abalone fed diets high in antioxidative compounds during heat stress. Tentacle transcriptomes of 40 greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were investigated to determine the combined effects of differing diets and temperature on the gene expression responses by abalone. Here we compare the functional gene expression changes at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C in abalone fed common commercial, live macroalgal (Ulva lactuca) and grape seed extract supplemented commercial diets as a means to understand the resulting high survival of abalone fed grape seed extract during heat stress. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed between high survival promoting diets (macroalgae or grape seed extract supplemented commercial) relative to the purely commercial diet. Many of these genes have been suggested to be involved in antioxidant and innate immunity responses. The identification of these genes and their functional roles has enhanced our understanding of processes that contribute to summer stress resilience in abalone.

Adult snails (shell length: 9.09 +/- 0.87 mm) were fed diatoms, including pennate marine diatom (Nitzschia grossestriata), boat-shaped diatom algae (Navicula sp.) and Cylindrotheca sp., along with giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) commercial feed, sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca), or Cladophora fascicularis, while snail larvae (shell length: 154.85 +/- 6.03 mu m) were fed Isochrysis galbana or Chaetoceros muelleri. The diatom group outperformed commercial feed and U. lactuca groups. The highest capsule productivity, yielding 79-82 capsules in 4 weeks, occurred at 15%o-20%o salinity for diatom-fed adults. Embryos thrived at 0%o but didn't hatch; hatching required salinities above 0%o, highlighting saline necessity. In addition, acute salinity changes (0%o to 30%o) can deform embryo. Embryonic development at 15%o-20%o salinity lasted 13.56-14.33 days with 100% larval hatching. However, larvae hatched at >20%o salinity exhibit improved the percentage of survival without feeding (longer median lethal times). I. galbana-fed larvae survived 68 days with a 75% rate, outlasting C. muelleri-fed larvae which perished within 28 days. I. galbana-fed larvae, raised for 68 days at 25%o salinity, showed 100% survival, 44.44% metamorphosis, and a 3.1 times growth increase. Metamorphosis rates were highest at 25%o salinity with I. galbana, exceeding the 20%o group by 3.2 times.

Changes in specific activity of seven enzymes (amylase, glycogen hydrolase, carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), laminarinase, alginate lyase, protease and lipase) were investigated in urchins of test diameters (TDs) 1.0-3.5, 3.0-4.5 and 6.0-9.2 mm to elucidate ontogenetic and diet-responsive changes. GRs were generally higher in urchins of < 6 mm TD fed microalgae than in those fed macroalgae. However, GRs of urchins fed macroalgae increased linearly for a TD of a parts per thousand 3 mm to a TD of a parts per thousand 6 mm. Activity for every enzyme was low in urchins < 3 mm in TD. Development of enzyme production capacity and increased ability to regulate enzyme activity in response to ingested diets were observed for urchins > 3 mm in TD. Our results suggest that the primary nutrient source of S. intermedius shifts from microalgae to macroalgae at a parts per thousand 6 mm TD, and that macroalgae digestion efficiency in urchins a parts per thousand yen3 mm TD gradually improves because of activation of the enzymes.

This growth should use technologies with economical and environmental sustainability. Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms. As in certain traditional polyculture schemes, plants can drastically reduce feed use and environmental impact of industrialized mariculture and at the same time add to its income. These nutrient-assimilating photoautotrophic plants use solar energy to turn nutrient-rich effluents into profitable resources. Plants counteract the environmental effects of the heterotrophic fed fish and shrimp and restore waterquality. Today's integrated intensive aquaculture approaches, developed from traditional extensive polyculture, integrate the culture of fish or shrimp with vegetables, microalgae, shellfish and/or seaweeds. Integrated mariculture can take place in coastal waters or in ponds and can be highly intensified. Today's technologies are well studied and documented. They are generic, modular and adaptable for several culture combinations of fish, shrimp, shellfish, abalone, sea urchin and several species of commercially important seaweeds and vegetables. A I-ha land-based integrated seabream-shellfish-seaweed farm can produce 25 tons of fish, 50 tons of bivalves and 30 tons fresh weight of seaweeds annually. Another farm model can produce in I ha 55 tons of seabream or 92 tons of salmon, with 385 or 500 fresh weight of seaweed, respectively, without pollution. Preliminary calculations show a potential for high profitability with large integrated farms. Several freshwater integrated fish-vegetable farms and a couple of modem fish-algae-shellfish/abalone integrated mariculture farms exist today, and several additional farms are planned. Three major international R&D projects promise to soon expand the horizons of the technology further. Therefore, modem integrated systems in general, and seaweed-based systems in particular, are bound to play a major role in the sustainable expansion of world aquaculture. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Gut microbiota plays critical roles in the physiological functions of aquatic animals, and it is influenced by numerous factors. Previous studies about the gut microbiota of abalone usually focused on analyzing bacterial taxonomy or the impact of a single abiotic factor. However, the effect of abiotic factors, combined with biotic factors (i.e., genotype), on gut microbiota of abalone has not been systematically explored. In China, the hybrid Haliotis discus hannai. x H. fulgens. has potential for large-scale farming in southern China by its fast growth rate and tolerance to higher temperature. In this study, we analyzed the effects of diet, temperature and genotypes on gut microbiota of abalones using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. The experiments indicate that the top three dominant genera keep consistent across various temperatures, diets and genotypes. The alpha-diversity of the microbial community was affected by temperature, genotype and diet. On the whole, the alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota of H. discus hannai was higher than that of the hybrid under the same temperature or diet. For beta-diversity, the microbial samples exhibited clear groups under abiotic gradients of temperature and diet. Some of the identified temperature-specific and diet-specific OTUs and KEGG Orthologs are related with degradation of carrageenan, laminaran and agar; metabolism of carbohydrate; biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and antibiotics, etc. According to permutational multivariate ANOVA, temperature and diet could explain almost 52% of bacterial structure variation. The gut microbiota of the two abalone genotypes have different responses to environmental gradients of temperature and diet. The gut microbiota of H. discus hannai is more sensitive to temperature, while the hybrid is more sensitive to diet, which might be the potential explanation of its tolerance to higher temperature in breeding.

Crabs consumed more juvenile mussels and abalone than seaweed (Ulva lactuca) and fed preferentially on the smallest mussels (6- to 10-mm size class). Further experiments showed that predation on mussels by P. crassipes was highly size dependent, with the largest crabs consuming over twenty-five 15-mm mussels per day. Field outplant experiments revealed that P. crassipes consumed high numbers of juvenile mussels in a natural setting, meaning that it could substantially affect mussel recruitment.

It is therefore economically desirable to maximize the conversion of feed protein into a valuable biomass, and environmentally desirable to minimize nitrogenous waste. Both ends can be achieved in algal-dependent integrated mariculture. Unlike fish-cage effluents, fishpond effluents can be treated. Use of marketable organisms as biofilters increases both diversification and income of the mariculture operation. Algal biofiltration has a stabilizing influence on water quality since, unlike bacteria, algae counteract the consumption of oxygen and the production Of CO2 by the fish. However, algal biofilters probably cost more to build and use a larger land area when compared with the alternative bacterial nitrification-denitrification aquaculture biofilter systems. Biofiltration by algae and shellfish, as has been developed as a part of integrated mariculture at the Israeli National Center for Mariculture, offsets the added cost by added sales of the biofilter organisms. This approach is based on algal sunlight-dependent assimilation of nutrients and their conversion into microalgal or macroalgal biomass. The algae are then consumed by algivore invertebrates such as bivalves, gastropods, and sea urchins. Sea urchins in particular can also be used to remove organic detritus. In the fish-phytoplankton-bivalve integrated culture system, bivalves filter microalgae that develop in fishponds and sedimentation ponds in which fishpond effluents collect. Such systems require large treatment areas relative to fish production, and are therefore suitable for extensive or semi-intensive fish culture with relatively low land costs. In fish-seaweed integrated culture, nutrients are removed from the fishpond effluents by green macroalgae such as Ulva lactuca. The macroalgae (seaweeds) can subsequently be fed to macroalgivores or processed for human consumption. While water from the fishponds passes through the macroalgae ponds, most of the ammonia (up to 90%,,) and significant fractions of other dissolved nutrients are removed from the water. The macroalgae improve the quality of the water by adding O-2 and removing excess CO2, thus making the water suitable for recirculation into the fishponds. The seaweed produced is excellent for feeding high-value macroalgivores such as abalone and sea urchins. Fish-seaweed integrated systems require less extensive land area than fish-phytoplankton-bivalve integrated systems and produce cleaner effluents. However, they may require larger inputs of capital and energy.

The lethal total residual chlorine (TRC) concentration that killed 50% of the test organisms (LC50) for the red-tide dinoflagellates Gymnodinium catenatum, Cochlodinium polykrikoides, Akashiwo sanguinea, Lingulodinium polyedrum, Prorocentrum micans, Alexandrium affine, and Gymnodinium impudicum ranged from 57 to 157 ppb for 10 min exposure and from 30 to 106 ppb for 1 h exposure. Complete mortality of all red-tide species occurred at TRC concentrations of similar to 500 ppb. The LC(50)s of the diatoms Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira rotula, 3083-3383 ppb for 10 min exposure and 3128-3433 ppb for 1 h exposure, were much higher than for red-tide dinoflagellates. But the LC50S of the heterotrophic dinoflagellates Polykrikos kofoidii and Oxyrrhis marina were similar to those of red-tide dinoflagellates. The ciliate Strombidinopsis sp. had LC(50)s of 306 ppb for. 10 min exposure and 119 ppb for 1 h exposure, which are higher than those for dinoflagellates. The LC(50)a of the calanoid copepods Acartia spp. and Pseudodiaptomus sp. were 1397-1493 ppb for 10 min exposure and 744-987 ppb for 1 h exposure, and those for larvae of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana were 4905 ppb for 10 m exposure and 2814 ppb for 1 h exposure. The LC(50)s of juvenile gray mullet Mugil cephalus and juvenile black rockfish Sebastes schlegeli were 1234-1883 ppb for 10 min exposure and 1234-1440 ppb for 1 h exposure, whereas those of adult Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum and spat of the abalone Nordotis discus were > 20,000 ppb. The LC(50)s of the macroalgae Griffithsia japonica (Rhodophyta) and Ulva pertusa (Chlorophyta) were 1519-12,365 ppb for 10 min exposure and 1085-12,558 ppb for 1 h exposure. The present study therefore suggests that, if NaOCl is introduced into waters containing red-tide organisms at TRC concentrations of 300-500 ppb for 10 min exposure and 200-400 ppb for 1 h exposure, red tides can be effectively controlled without serious harmful effects on other marine organisms, except heterotrophic dinoflagellates.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000180236700009,

The demand is increasing especially for proteins as ingredients; however, the amino acid profile is essential for evaluation of the nutritional value of proteins. The year-round protein concentration and amino acid profiles of Saccharina latissima were determined, and the harvest time and nutritional potential were evaluated. Bi-monthly samples were analyzed from S. latissima (including epiphytes, when present) cultivated commercially at an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) site and a reference site in Denmark in 2013-2014. Overall, there was no significant difference for the tested parameters between the two sampling sites; however, seasonal variations were found. The protein concentration varied markedly reaching a maximum of 10.8 % dry weight (DW) in November and a minimum of 1.3 % DW in May 2013. Aspartic and glutamic acids dominated the amino acid profile, accounting for up to 49 % of the total. Greatest seasonal differences in amino acid composition occurred in July, with leucine contributing most (22.7-26.7 %) of the observed differences. A maximal essential amino acid (EAA) score of 68.9 % (based on WHO/FAO/UNU requirements) was achieved in November 2013. The presence of epiphytes in July to November changed neither the amino acid content nor the EAA score. S. latissima is comparable with wheat as a protein ingredient for fish feed and appears to be a suitable protein/amino acid source for human consumption. This study proposes that there may be a mismatch between harvest time and nutritional value. The preferable harvest time for S. latissima is November, due to high protein content and EAA score. However, higher yield and cleaner biomass for human consumption would be found in May.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000361891600026,

At settlement, two plate conditioning times for the green alga Ulvella lens (conditioned for 6 or 8 wk) were evaluated and compared with plates colonized by different diatom species (Navicula cf. jeffreyi and Cocconeis sp.). In a choice experiment an overall settlement rate of 87% was estimated 3 days after larval release. The majority of the larvae chose to settle on U. lens (61% on 8-wk-old and 14% on 6-wk-old U. lens, with average algal cover of 97% and 82% respectively). Larvae showed a clear preference for older than for younger U. lens, with similar percentage cover. indicating that the developmental stage of the alga and not percentage cover per se is important in settlement induction. Only 7% and 5% respectively of the settled larvae were found on the plates colonized by the diatom species N. cf. jeffreyi and Cocconeis sp. Results clearly demonstrate that U. lens provides a suitable substrate to improve the settlement of Haliotis laevigata larvae on commercial scale. Juvenile growth (mu m day(-1)) oil a mixed diet of U. lens and N. c jeffreyi was not constant and increased with size to 70-80 mu m day(-1). Both growth rate and size variability increased over time until juveniles reached approximately 5 mm in shell length. The survival declined to ca. 30% at 44 days after settlement but stabilized thereafter. Distinct increases in size variability were observed between 3 and 16 and between 30 and 44 days after settlement. followed by elevated growth rates and a change from monomodal to multimodal distribution at day 44. The latter coincided with a shift in diet from a diatom-dominated diet to a macroalgal diet of U. lens at day 44. The increase in growth rate between 3 and 16 days is believed to reflect a shift in nutrition with postlarvae switching from absorbing yolk reserves to efficient exogenous feeding. The growth. Survival, and size variability of juveniles was assessed when feeding on algal diets as well as a formulated diet. Juveniles grew faster on U. lens than on a formulated feed or plates colonized with the diatom N. cf. jeffreyi. Results indicate that growth Of juveniles may be more variable when feeding on natural feed (Navicula cf jeffreyi., U. lens) than on a formulated feed.

During this period, abalone pass through profound morphological and physiological changes, which suitable nutrient requirements must sustain. An inadequate diet can result in adverse effects such as late metamorphosis, starvation, slow growth and even death during this phase. Two strategies have been proposed to increase the growth and survival rates of weaning abalone: (i) extending feeding with benthic diatoms and (ii) abalone hybridization via interspecific crosses. To evaluate the efficiency of the two strategies, we assessed the growth and survival rates of postlarvae of pure red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and a hybrid obtained by crossing red abalone females with green abalone (H. fulgens) males. Both crosses were supplied with six different diets consisting of either one macroalgae mono-diet (Macrocystis pyrifera or Ulva ohnoi) or a mixture with Navicula incerta. Overall, cross-specific diets achieved better growth rates, suggesting that each cross may need specific food items (nutrients) during weaning.

Food was generally given every other day at a rate of 30% and 3% of total body weight for Graciliaria tenuistipitata and artificial diet, respectively. Survival was 64.3-71.4% and 61.4-78.6% in the Gracilaria and artificial diet, respectively. Growth of abalone placed on the top tier was inferior to those placed on the middle and bottom tiers. In the first 33 days, the growth rate of H. diversicolor supertexta fed Gracilaria and the artificial diet was 61-101 and 105-163 mu m/day, respectively. The abalone fed an artificial diet gained twice as much total body weight as those fed Gracilaria after 96 days. The overall growth rate of abalone fed an artificial diet was 24.4, 47.7, and 47.9 mg/day, or 1.8, 2.2, and 2.2 times higher than abalone fed Gracilaria, on the top, middle, and bottom tiers, respectively. The FCR (feed conversion ratio) in dry weight of food was 3.10, 2.68, and 2.76 for the abalone fed an artificial diet, and 4.43, 3.03, and 3.04 for those fed Gracilaria.

In these systems seaweeds are the ultimate source of energy with any changes in the seaweeds invariably affecting species of higher trophic levels. Seaweeds are rich sources of nutritionally important compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and are particularly rich in long-chain (>= C-20) PUFA (LC-PUFA). In southern Australia, the 'Great Southern Reef' has one of the most diverse assemblages of seaweeds in the world, which support highly productive fisheries and have been recognised as a promising resource of omega-3 LC-PUFA. Despite this, there is little information on the biochemical composition of most species and how it varies between sites and seasons. To address this knowledge gap, we undertook a survey to assess seasonal variability in the biochemical composition (fatty acids and nitrogen content) of abundant understory seaweeds across three sites in eastern Tasmania. The availability of nutritional compounds differed between sites and was primarily driven by differences in the biomass and the biochemical composition of the nutritious red seaweeds at each site. This variability may explain regional differences in the productivity of commercial fisheries. At the species level, seasonal changes in fatty acid composition were highly variable between species and sites, indicating that multiple environmental drivers influence fatty acid composition of seaweeds in this system. This finding suggests that commercial harvest of seaweeds from eastern Tasmania will need to consider species and site-specific variability in fatty acid composition.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000581549000001,

A significantly different response to the macroalgal diets by the two sea urchin species was found in terms of food consumption rate, food conversion efficiency, gonadal growth and gonad nutritional composition. P miliaris was able to efficiently utilise the High-N P palmata, whereas P lividus exhibited a higher food conversion efficiency (FCE) and specific growth rate (SGR) when fed the Low-N compared with the High-N P palmata. P miliaris had a significantly higher food consumption rate and higher gonad index (GI) compared with P lividus, irrespective of diet type. The lowest FCE, SGR and GI were shown by both species fed L. saccharina. No interspecific difference in gonadal nitrogen content was observed, although a positive relationship was shown between dietary and gonadal nitrogen content for both species. All three macroalgal diets produced bright orange or yellow orange gonad colour in P lividus. High-N and Low-N P. palmata improved gonad colouration in P miliaris compared with L. saccharina. The results suggest that P. miliaris can efficiently assimilate high protein plant-based diet, whereas P. lividus is less capable of benefiting from high dietary protein levels and this should be taken into consideration when culturing this species either in land-based or sea-based polyculture systems.

As lipid metabolism is closely linked with protein metabolism, protein intake during maturation may significantly influence transport proteins and enzyme activity which is responsible for supplying the essential fatty acids for gamete development. The present study investigated the influence of increased protein intake on the accumulation of certain long-chain PUFA in two species of commercially valuable sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus and Psammechinus miliaris during maturation. Sea urchins were fed three macroalgal diets over a 90-day period. These diets included the red alga Palmaria palmata, which had been grown in seawater enriched with two levels of ammonia-N, which produced a high protein content (41%) or low protein content (32%). The third diet (or reference diet) used the brown macroalga Laminaria saccharina with a 23% protein content. The fatty acid composition of the gonads was determined by GC. Feeding the high protein diet had no effect on the maturation and total lipid in the gonad compared with the low protein diet, however, it did significantly increase the levels of docosahexaenoic acid DHA 22:6n-3 in the mature gonad tissue in P. miliaris and P. lividus. In contrast, only P. miliaris exhibited higher levels of arachidonic acid ARA 20:4n-6 when fed the high protein diet. The present study suggests that elevated protein levels can promote the accumulation of DHA and ARA in gonadal tissue during maturation, although the extent of the influence is species-specific and highlights the importance of understanding the complexities and inter-connectivity between protein and lipid metabolism when producing commercially valuable species.

L. undosum did not discriminate among three kelp foods (Egregia menziesii, Eisenia arborea and Macrocystis pyrifera) but ate kelp preferentially and more rapidly over all but Ulva spp. among tested macrophytes. Secondary preferences were established for the red alga Pterocladiella capillacea, followed by the coralline Lithothrix aspergillum, whereas the brown seaweeds Zonaria farlowii and Halidrys dioica and the seagrass Phyllospadix torreyi were the least preferred macrophytes. Fastest consumption rates (1.91 g day(-1)) were measured in trials consisting only of kelp foods. These results indicate that L. undosum exhibits clear feeding preferences even when given less-preferred, non-kelp macrophytes. Using an ash-marker technique, we determined total organic, carbon, and nitrogen assimilation efficiencies (AE%) for six macroalgae used in preference trials. Tested macrophytes were assimilated at different efficiencies but a pattern was not detected between AE (%) and a macrophyte's position in L. undosum's preference hierarchy. Highest total organic AEs were found for P. capillacea (61.2%) and H. dioica (59.4%); lowest AEs were detected for E. menziesii (34.9%), a preferred dietary item. Nitrogen was assimilated from red algae with higher efficiencies (74.9-84.3%) than from brown or green algae. These data suggest that the digestive capabilities of L. undosum are better suited for assimilating organic material and nitrogen from less-preferred, non-kelp foods. This supports the hypothesis that factors besides nutritional composition and digestive optimization have played a role in the evolution of feeding preferences in L. undosum and probably other herbivorous snails associated with northeastern Pacific kelp beds.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000236382800011,

Open questions relate to effects of surface irradiance on growth rate and yield in such tumble cultures and the possibility of chronic photoinhibition in full sunlight. A specially constructed shallow-depth tank combined with a dark tank allowed fast circulation times of approximately 5 s, at a density of 4.2 kg fresh weight (FW) m(-2) s(-1). Growth rate and yield of the red alga Palmaria palmata increased over a wide range of irradiances, with no signs of chronic photoinhibition, up to a growth-saturating irradiance of approximately 1600 mumol m(-2) s(-1) in yellowish light supplied by a sodium high pressure lamp at 16 h light per day. Maximum growth rate ranged at 12% FW d(-1), and maximum yield at 609 g FW m(-2) d(-1). This shows that high growth rates of individual thalli may be reached in a dense tumble culture, if high surface irradiances and short circulation times are supplied. Another aspect of intermittent light relates to possible changes of basic growth kinetics, as compared to continuous light. For this purpose on-line measurements of growth rate were performed with a daily light reduction by 50% in light-dark cycles of 1, 2 or 3 min duration during the daily light period. Growth rates at 10degreesC and 50 mumol photon m(-2) s- 1 dropped in all three intermittent light regimes during both the main light and dark periods and reached with all three periodicities approximately 50% of the control, with no apparent changes in basic growth kinetics, as compared to continuous light.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000224436600002,

The rates of weight gain, nutritional indices and body composition of both the smaller (0.2-1.0 g) and larger (7.0-14.0 g) abalone were significantly affected by the levels of protein and energy in the diets. Moreover, the two size classes of abalone differed in their responses to the diets. Maximum growth was achieved at a higher dietary protein level in the larger abalone (44%) than the smaller abalone (34%). The protein content of the larger abalone soft tissue was higher (ca. 7%) than the smaller abalone. Irrespective of the lipid content, the percentage of protein deposited by the larger abalone was highest in those fed the 34 and 44% protein diets, whereas that of the smaller abalone was highest for the 24 and 34% protein diets. The condition factor (CF) of small abalone was significantly higher for those fed the 24% protein diets in comparison to those fed the 34 and 44% protein diets, whereas the reverse was found in the larger abalone. It was concluded that the larger abalone had a higher protein requirement than the smaller abalone. Diets containing the highest level of dietary fat (10%) produced significantly lower growth rates and efficiencies of protein deposition in comparison to abalone fed the diets containing 6 and 2% fat, however, these trends were more marked among the small abalone size class. In addition, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of small abalone fed the 10% fat diets was consistently poorer, but this trend was not present among the larger abalone whose FCR improved with an increasing PE ratio. It was concluded that a dietary lipid level of 10% is too high for H. midae to maintain a maximal growth rate.

However, the growth rates of abalone fed on four diatom species, which were readily digested, were higher than those of abalone fed on the other five species of diatom. The cell walls of the former four diatom species were easily broken open when they were grazed by abalone because of their high adhesive strength (three species), or due to the weakly silicified cell walls (one species with a low adhesive strength). The other five species, whose adhesive strengths are low, were easily ingested by abalone without any deformation of the cell walls and the majority of them were excreted whole and still alive. It is considered that post-larval abalone cannot digest diatom cell contents in their alimentary canal without first rupturing the cell wall with the radula.

These were then used to explain the growth rates, intakes and chemosensory preferences of abalone in that study. The chemosensory preferences of abalone were strongly related to the digestible nitrogen content of the algae and to a slightly lesser extent the nitrogen content of the algae, indicating the important role nitrogen plays in setting preferences in this abalone. The intakes of digestible nitrogen were significantly related to the growth rates of abalone, suggesting that nitrogen is a limiting nutrient to abalone growth, Thus, N. rubra selects those foods which maximise the intake of nitrogen and result in maximum growth rates. Energy does not appear to play a major role in setting abalone preference as the digestible energy contents of algae in this study (and in general) are similar and did not correlate with preference. The digestible nitrogen content was lowest in the 3 brown algae tested and digestibility was related to the polyphenolic content of the brown algae.

Abalone exhibited distinct preferences, the most preferred being J. lobata and the least preferred the phenolic-rich E. radiata.

In this review, the current knowledge of these two commercially important seafood species is explored for a comprehensive understanding of its aquaculture status. The various culture methods and systems, animal nutrition and necessary improvements are discussed for abalone and limpets, respectively. For abalone, the knowledge base is extensive and some reviews have been written to compile essential information regarding different aspects of this healthy industry. For limpets, there is a small collection of aquaculture literature, and this is, to the authors' knowledge, the first comprehensive review of the research. Our goal was to reveal, within the area of aquaculture research, the current status of both abalone and limpet industries while exposing their respective knowledge gaps for appropriate development of new technologies.

We utilized the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and the red seaweed dulse (Devaleraea mollis) as our study species and designed integrated tanks at three different recirculation rates (0%, 30%, and 65% recirculation per hour) to test how an integrated design would affect growth rates of the abalone and seaweeds, modify nutrient levels, and change water chemistry. We specifically hypothesized that IMTA designs would raise seawater pH to benefit calcifying species. Our results indicated that juvenile abalone grew significantly faster in weight (22% increase) and shell area (11% increase) in 6 months in tanks with the highest recirculation rates (65%). The 65% recirculation treatment also exhibited a significant increase in mean seawater pH (0.2 pH units higher) due to the biological activity of the seaweed in the connected tanks. We found a significant positive relationship between the mean pH of seawater in the tanks and juvenile abalone growth rates across all treatments. There were no significant differences in the growth of dulse among treatments, but dulse growth did vary seasonally. Seawater phosphate and nitrate concentrations were depleted in the highest recirculation rate treatment, but ammonium concentrations were elevated, likely due to the abalone effluent. Overall, our results indicate that there are benefits to IMTA culture of seaweeds and abalone in terms of improving growth in land-based systems, which will reduce the time to market and buffer commercial abalone operations against the effects of ocean acidification during vulnerable early life stages.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000838214200005,

In the second experiment we have measured the effects of two different settlement substrates, combined with the presence of conspecifics, onmetamorphosis, survival and growth of post-larvae. The microalgae dietary treatments consisted in: Dunaliella tertiolecta (Duna); 50% mixture of Isochrysis galbana and D. tertiolecta (ID); 50% mixture of Chaetoceros gracilis and D. tertiolecta (CD); 33% mixture of I. galbana, C. gracilis and D. tertiolecta (ICD). Although all dietary treatments resulted in a good survival at competence, significant difference in post-larval survival was observed between treatments, and indeed, only larvae fed Duna and CD survived to 180 days post settlement (DPS). In the second experiment, the settlement substrates consisted in a film of cultured Ulvella lens or a naturally developing biofilm of diatoms, and the employed rearing water was either natural seawater or seawater previously exposed to P. lividus adults. At 10 DPS, larger (p < 0.05) post-larvae were observed in the natural biofilm treatment, whilst the presence of conspecifics significantly increased larval settlement in both substrates (p < 0.01). These results indicate that it is important to consider the survival of post-larvae and juveniles to establish the efficiency of the dietary treatment on the hatchery production of P. lividus. Furthermore, it suggests that improved settlement protocols, such as the use of conspecifics, could contribute to increase hatchery outputs. Finally, it confirms the suitability of U. lens as settlement cue but also highlights that further research is required to establish its effectiveness for post-larvae first feeding.

The current study evaluated different substrates to induce settlement in P. aspera, including microalgae strains (Halamphora coffeaeformis, Navicula incerta and Pavlova sp.) and crustose coralline algae (CCA) obtained from limpet shells. The results showed that gametes obtained by dissection and matured artificially using alkalinized seawater baths can produce viable larvae able to metamorphose to juveniles. Feeding was not required during larval development, suggesting lecithotrophy. Early postlarvae were identified by the shedding of the velum, and juveniles were identified by teleoconch and active grazing behaviour. The presence of CCA shortened the timing for settlement and increased the ratio of juveniles. The type and abundance of CCA can influence settlement success. Moreover, the results suggested that settlement and metamorphosis in true limpets (Patellogastropoda) might be triggered by a two-step mechanism, i.e. a first cue influencing the shift between swimming and crawling activity and a second cue determining settlement and metamorphosis to early postlarvae and juveniles.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000753671900001,

Global production of crustaceans (18% yr(-1)), molluscs (7.4%), and seaweed (8%) increased rapidly during the 1970-2006 period. Scenarios indicate that annual nutrient release from all shellfish (crustaceans, bivalves, and gastropods) aquaculture will rapidly grow from 0.4 to up to 1.7 million tonnes of nitrogen and from 0.01 to 0.3 million tonnes of phosphorus between 2006 and 2050. The nitrogen and phosphorus releases from global freshwater shellfish aquaculture will increase from 1% of river export in 2006 to up to 6% in 2050. Marine shellfish production is an important contributor to nutrient loading of coastal seas, particularly in Eastern Asia. Nitrogen (7% of marine aquaculture + river export in 2006 and up to 19% in 2050) and phosphorus (12% in 2006 and up to 30% in 2050) releases from Chinese marine shellfish aquaculture are important and growing contributors to total nutrient inputs to coastal seas. Production of crustaceans and bivalves causes changes in nutrient stoichiometry and increasing reduced and organic nitrogen forms, which are of concern because of their preferential use by some harmful algae. Nutrient withdrawal by seaweed is projected to increase rapidly over the coming decades. To overcome effects of increasing nutrient release from shellfish production, integrated systems that include seaweed may play an important role in reducing this nutrient load.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000297511500002,

A novel non-destructive method of digital shell color analysis to reveal the diets of European abalone (ormer) was developed in this study. The method was calibrated using ormers reared under experimental conditions in North Western Brittany in 2012 and fed a controlled monospecific diet to define the shell hues associated with various macroalgae (i.e., Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, and Phaeophyta). General food preferences were established by comparing the shell hue of wild adult ormers and experimental adult ormers. Shell hue corresponds to the color tint in the HSL color space measured on digital pictures of the shell. Experimentally, shell hue values differed according to treatment, with the most yellow-green hue (72 degrees) for ormers fed Saccharina sp. and the coral hue (25 degrees) for ormers fed Palmaria palmata. High variation in shell color of wild ormers was observed according to the sampling site and/or ontogeny. The diet of wild ormers may be related to the abundance of different drifting algae in their respective habitats. Thus, this non-destructive and easy-to-use technique appears to be a promising tool for determining the diet of Haliotis species and, perhaps, other herbivorous mollusks.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000398579400010,

Feeding behavior was scored in terms of the following activities: quiescence, alertness, moving, feeding, distance traveled, velocity, and homing. There was a significant effect of diet type and temperature on feeding behavior of abalone. Both types of abalone were more active and exhibited the highest velocity when fed the formulated diet at 22 degrees C. Greenlip abalone spent a larger proportion of time feeding on Ulva sp. than on the formulated diet, regardless of the water temperature. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the proportion of time feeding between diet types for hybrid abalone. Both types of abalone rapidly located and consumed Ulva sp. when feed was introduced into the aquaria at 1600 h (light phase). In contrast, abalone predominantly commenced feeding on the formulated diet in the dark phase, indicating the potential of Ulva sp. as feed attractant in abalone diet, to promote feeding. The mode in which abalone consumed feed also differed between diets. Abalone fed the formulated diet nibbled intermittently on random chips, whereas when fed Ulva sp., abalone engulfed entire individual fronds before moving on to the next available frond. Greenlip and hybrid abalone exhibited homing behavior at the completion of the dark phase, which was more pronounced in abalone fed Ulva sp.

However, interactions with other important local and global drivers such as ocean acidification, eutrophication and sedimentation, and the physiological mechanisms via which MHWs act on species are poorly understood. Additionally, past studies have often focused on ecologically dominant taxa such as kelps, fucoids and coral, potentially leading to a lack of understanding of direct impacts on associated species. To this end, we examined the individual and interactive impacts of MHW duration (14 and 28 days) and intensity (20.5 degrees C and 23 degrees C) as well as irradiance (2.3 and 4.4 mol m(-2) d(-1)) on standardized growth of Caulerpa brownii, Corallina berteroi and Phymatolithopsis complex, three temperate macroalgal taxa that are important spaceholders in their native ecosystem in Te Whanganui a Tara Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand. All three taxa exhibited no declines in growth in response to the exposure to longer and more intense MHWs. We posit that the simulated MHW scenarios were tolerated due to large thermal safety margins which can be expected from the range centre/leading edge position of the sampled populations, even though some of these scenarios far exceeded the intensities encountered in this region previously. Interactions between intensity, duration and irradiance were limited to an antagonistic irradiance-duration interaction in the non-calcareous green macroalga Ca. brownii only.

For feeding larval forms, food variability has significant consequences for growth and later recruitment success. In this study, the physiological and biochemical responses to a range of different food concentrations (unfed, 4, 20, and 40 algal cells mu l(-1)) were examined in larvae of the asteroid, Asterina miniata. Measurements of growth, protein synthesis rates, and the energetic cost of protein synthesis were made. Under conditions of rapid growth, protein comprised a larger percent (66%) of a larva's organic biomass compared to similar-aged, slower-growing larvae (26%). Larvae fed at the highest food concentration tested (40 algal cells mu l(-1)) had a protein depositional efficiency of 80% (+/-16%), a value 3-fold higher than larvae fed 20 algal cells mu l(-1) (28%+/-11%). Also, faster-growing larvae required 3-fold less energy per unit mass of protein growth. Larvae fed 40 algal cells mu l(-1) deposited protein at a respiratory cost of 65+/-11 pmol O-2 h(-1) (mu g protein)(-1); larvae fed 20 algal cells mu l(-1) had a cost of 192+/-47 pmol O-2 h(-1) (mu g protein)(-1). While there were differences in the cost to deposit protein (i.e., protein growth, the balance of synthesis and degradation), there were no differences in the energetic cost of protein synthesis for all food concentrations tested. The energetic cost of protein synthesis was fixed at 13.8 (+/-0.92) Joules (mg protein synthesized)(-1) and was independent of developmental stage, growth rates, and large changes (58-fold) in protein synthesis rates. A major conclusion from this study is that larvae grown in high-food environments not only grew faster, but did so for considerably less energy. Defining the complex relationships of food availability and metabolic efficiency will provide more accurate predictions of larval growth under variable food conditions in the ocean.

Both Cu and Zn were effectively accumulated by the abalones from water or macroalgae, but their concentration factors and trophic transfer factors were low due to the regulation of Cu and Zn accumulation. Following waterborne or dietary exposure, the abalones exhibited different accumulation patterns of Cu and Zn. The tissue Zn burden decreased quickly after the initial accumulation, and the incoming Zn was mainly deposited in the viscera. In contrast, the tissue Cu burden increased rapidly and gradually reached a steady state. The abalone muscle exhibited a comparable storage capacity of Cu as the viscera and the accumulated Cu in muscle was mainly derived from the dissolved phase instead of trophic transfer. The feeding and growth of the abalone were not influenced in all the exposure regimes. Moreover, the significant induction of metallothionein indicated that the bioaccumulated metals were actively detoxified. In the metal-exposed abalones, more Cu was distributed into the biologically detoxified fractions (metallothionein-like protein and/or metal-rich granule), whereas no significant subcellular redistribution of Zn was observed.

In this 91-d study we investigated the effects of feeding four diets containing graded levels of crude protein (CP; 27, 30, 33 and 36%) at three seasonal water temperatures (14, 17 and 20 degrees C) on the energy budget components for 6-month-old Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata, (0.91 g; 19.46 mm shell length). The increase of water temperature significantly increased individual energy budget components, rates for somatic growth energy, respiration energy and shell growth energy of abalone. Ammonia excretion energy rate was positively related to increasing dietary CP levels. In contrast, there were significant interactions between water temperature and dietary CP levels for ingested feed energy rate, absorbed energy rate and egested faecal energy rate. For energy budgets, respiration energy accounted for the largest proportion and ranged between 34.1 and 43.9% of the ingested feed energy. Somatic growth energy (16.80-28.10%) also accounted for a large proportion of the energy budget. Although egested faecal energy was lower, it still accounted for 8.2-17.9% of the ingested feed energy. In contrast, pedal mucus production energy (4.12-6.20%), ammonia excretion energy (0.28-1.40%) and shell growth energy (0.22-0.46%) accounted for relatively smaller proportions of ingested feed energy. Water temperature significantly impacted energy budgets more than dietary CP level. To maximise energy transfer to somatic growth, a water temperature of 20 degrees C is recommended for culturing Greenlip Abalone. Additionally, to minimise energy loss through faecal egestion, a dietary CP level of 36% is recommended for the diet of 6-month-old Greenlip Abalone at optimum water temperatures. However, the increase in ammonia excretion energy at high dietary CP should also be considered when managing water quality and waste production in abalone farms, especially where tank water exchange is limited.

Density and food were manipulated to test their interacting effects on the growth and survival of hatchery produced postlarval Haliotis rubra. Feeding and dispersive behavior was also examined. Initial densities ranged between the densities used in aquaculture and those reported in the natural environment. Higher initial density increased the mortality rates of postlarvae in two experiments. Simultaneous manipulation of diatom food supply and density showed that the effect of density on mortality was mostly independent of food. Growth was strongly related to food supply, but also significantly reduced by high initial density, and these effects were additive. When diatom density was low, postlarvae did not increase rasping rates so the effect was that food was consumed more slowly. This explains the strong effect of food supply on growth. No aggressive interactions between feeding postlarvae were observed, but they graze intensively, leaving small distinct patches that have been cleared of algal food. Postlarvae encountering patches without food move rapidly and apparently randomly in search of food. The dispersal rate of postlarvae increased with density, presumably because post larvae spent more time searching for food. This searching is likely to be energetically expensive. and would increase at high densities because more cleared patches are created. This may explain why high initial densities of postlarvae had persistent reduced growth even when food was abundant, but does not explain the increased mortality at high density irrespective of food supply. We hypothesize that this effect may be attributable to other factors, such as the increased transmission of a pathogen at high density.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000227815000013,

The possible inositol-synthesizing capacity of intestinal microflora was also examined. Seven semipurified diets were formulated to provide graded levels of myo-inositol (28.7-1020.1 mg/kg diet). A control diet, the basal diet supplemented with 4 g/kg tetracycline hydrochloride, was employed to suppress synthesis of myo-inositol by intestinal bacteria. Abalone juveniles of similar size (weight, 144.6 +/- 0.8 mg; shell length, 10.92 +/- 0.10 mm) were distributed in a flow-through system using a completely randomized design with eight treatments and three replicates per treatment. They were fed the appropriate diets once daily for 16 wk. Survival, growth, crude protein, lipid, moisture of whole soft body and visceral inositol content were independent of myo-inositol supplementation (P > 0.05). The addition of the antibiotic also did not affect the survival, growth and whole soft body composition. It indicated that intestinal microflora contributed little to the myo-inositol nutrition in abalone. The present study, for the first time, demonstrated de novo synthesis of myo-inositol in mollusks because the visceral tissue of abalone showed high levels of myo-inositol synthetase activities (combined activities of myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthetase and inositol-1-phosphatase), ranging from 74.0 to 98.2 mu mol/(h.g protein). The enzyme activity significantly and negatively correlated with dietary myo-inositol level (r = -0.81). Hence, dietary myo-inositol is not essential for abalone because tissue synthesis of the vitamin appears to be sufficient to support normal growth and health of this mollusk.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000172244300015,

To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98% were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10%) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone. because juvenile abalone seem dependent on the urchins. The long-term consequences for the industry may be crucial.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000168463600013,

Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is one application of this principle. Inspired by the natural trophic chain, it associates primary producers with primary or secondary consumers, providing a new source of biomass without requiring supplementary feed by recycling inorganic and organic wastes. Of these systems, land-based IMTA demonstrate several advantages, especially easier control of nutrient flows, contaminants and/or predators. This study focused on a land-based marine IMTA, combining a recirculating aquaculture system for fish consecutively with a natural marine polyculture of microalgae and oyster cultivation. The objective was to assess the ability of the microalgal polyculture both to bioremediate fish nutrients and to sustain oyster growth. For the first time in a Mediterranean climate, we confirmed the feasibility of developing a microalgae community of interest for oysters maintained by fish effluent. Despite strong variability in microalgae production, this IMTA system resulted in significant oyster growth over the experimental period of 1 month, with growth results of the same order of magnitude as natural juvenile growth. In the conditions tested, this IMTA with reduced human intervention allowed a gain in recoverable biomass of 3.7 g of oyster produced per killogramme of fish feed distributed. By transforming waste into additional biomass, IMTA offer a more promising, ecological avenue for aquaculture, based on a circular economy, which may in turn increase the social acceptability of fish farming.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000840590400001,

The percentage of settled individuals on ethanol-killed M. crassissima was much lower than on intact M. crassissima. The results indicate that physical structure is unlikely to be the main inducer of settlement; therefore, settlement of top shell larvae seems to be strongly induced by chemicals from the two red algal species.

Larvae (130 degrees C.days old) had a well-formed radula with similar to 10 rows of teeth. Each row comprised 1 rachidian tooth, 2 pairs of lateral teeth, and 1 pair of marginal teeth. The number of rows of teeth increased to 26-29 by similar to 500 mu m SL (Day 10 post-settlement) and stayed at that level throughout the post-larval period (maximum size/age observed was 2.7 mm SL at Day 60). Marginal teeth were added steadily to give similar to 30 pairs per row at similar to 2.5 mm SL (compared to 60-80 in adults). Lateral teeth (L3-L5) were added between 1.0 and 1.7 mm SL to complete the adult complement. Progressive changes in the post-larval radula above 1-1.5 mm SL included: (1) reduction of serrations on the margins of rachidian and lateral teeth, particularly the more central (R, L1, L2) teeth; (2) increased spacing between adjacent rows of teeth; (3) lengthening of the outer lateral teeth (L3-L5) making them larger and taller than the central (R, L1, L2) teeth. The clearance angle of rachidian and lateral teeth was variable, but generally increased as post-larvae grew. Post-larvae <1 mm SL had highly curved teeth and apparent clearance angles around or below 0 degrees. Larger post-larvae had positive clearance angles. These developments suggest that the teeth of post-larvae <1 mm SL probably function as scoops which slide across the surface collecting small diatoms and other fine, loose particles.

Considering species importance in the analysis (Morisita's index) a different classification resulted. The divergence of the groups may be due to differences in sampling dates, while the correspondence of assemblages from different dates indicates mainly sharing of important (long-lived) species (E. arborea, C. osmundacea, C offlicinalis var. chilensis).

Chondrus canaliculatus is a red alga endemic to the temperate Pacific coast of South America and produces a complex carrageenan. In Chile, this potential marine resource has been underutilized since the early 1990s, after it was replaced mainly by imports of Kappaphycus and Eucheum from Asia. The study of the cultivation of C. canaliculatus in outdoor tanks demonstrates the potential to produce large quantities of algal material due to the high productivity observed. The material produced may be important in Chile as feed for cultured algal herbivores such as Haliotis spp. Data were obtained on the key factors affecting the growth of this alga, including light, temperature, and nutrient concentrations. The results showed that, on a dry weight basis, productivity varied seasonally between 40 g m(-3) wk(-1) in autumn and 200 g m(-3) wk(-1) in spring, and the optimal stocking density in our experiments was 8 kg m(-3). Effects of self-shading were among the most important limiting factors in the culture.

Abalone consumed three phenolic-poor algal species, Laminaria sinclarii (Harvey) Farlow, Macrocystis pyrifera Agardh, and Nereocystis luetkeana Postels et Ruprecht (mean phenolic content = 0.52% dry mass), at a greater rate than two phenolic-rich species, Dictyoneurum californicum Ruprecht and Cystoseira osmundacea Agardh (mean phenolic content = 4.60% dry mass). This inverse relationship between phenolic content and consumption rate also existed after the algae were macerated and the liquid portion of the blended slurry incorporated in agar discs. However, the correlation between grazing rate and phenolic content improved in this latter experiment, thus suggesting that abalone grazing was deterred significantly by the morphology of L. sinclarii and, to a lesser extent, of M. pyrifera. Polyphenolics extracted from D. californicum reduced abalone grazing rates by 90% when incorporated into agar discs at a concentration of 6 mg.ml-1. Although abalone were unable to maintain body mass when fed ad libitum on macerated M. pyrifera incorporated into agar discs, polyphenolics from D. californicum further inhibited shell growth when added to the discs at 5 mg.ml-1. The abalone ate less of the phenol-containing discs than of the discs lacking phenolics.

The potential algae requirements and consumable costs for each propagation method were determined, using experimental data and values from the literature, to assess the viability of utilizing each of these propagation methods in a commercial abalone nursery. The use of red algal spores required 592-52,000 kg of algae, depending on the level of spore release and the percentage of fertile algal thalli collected.

Abalone (Haliotis roei) and several species of limpets and chitons are abundant in the barren zone, which is generally devoid of non-coralline macroalgae. The relative importance of abalone versus limpets and chitons in limiting macroalgal abundance in the barren zone was evaluated by manipulating the presence of each group in a factorial experiment. Percentage algal cover was measured photographically in 0.25 M2 plots at 1-2 month intervals for 9 months. Mean algal cover (mainly the foliose green alga, Ulva rigida) was highest in plots where all grazers were excluded (77-99%), intermediate where only limpets and chitons were excluded (37-85%), and lowest where only abalone were excluded (4-30%) or where no grazers were excluded (2-19%). The effect of limpets and chitons accounted for 55-89% of the variance in total algal cover, whereas the effect of abalone generally accounted for < 10% of the variance. Similar results were obtained in terms of the biomass of Ulva rigida at the end of the experiment. Haliotis roei are relatively large and sedentary herbivores, feeding mainly on drift algae. Their effect on algal abundance was mediated both through pre-emption of space, which might otherwise be colonized by algae, and by grazing around their home scar. Limpets and chitons are smaller than abalone, but were much more abundant. Intensive grazing of the reef surface by limpets and chitons precluded the establishment of non-coralline macroalgae, even where abalone were absent.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:A1994NU14500003,

Energy losses in the form of ammonia excretion aree negligible, accounting for less than 1% of consumption. Some 5% of energy intake, or 13% of absorbed ration (Ab) is thus available for growth and reproductive output (Pg and Pr).

Contrastingly, facilitation can allow persistence of individuals arriving by chance and potentially maladapted to local abiotic conditions. For marine organisms, selection of a permanent attachment site at the end of their larval stage or the presence of a facilitator can be a critical determinant of recruitment success. In coral reef ecosystems, it is well known that settling planula larvae of reef-building corals use coarse environmental cues (i.e., light) for habitat selection. Although laboratory studies suggest that larvae can also use precise biotic cues produced by crustose coralline algae (CCA) to select attachment sites, the ecological consequences of biotic cues for corals are poorly understood in situ. In a field experiment exploring the relative importance of biotic cues and variability in habitat quality to recruitment of hard corals, pocilloporid and acroporid corals recruited more frequently to one species of CCA, Titanoderma prototypum, and significantly less so to other species of CCA; these results are consistent with laboratory assays from other studies. The provision of the biotic cue accurately predicted coral recruitment rates across habitats of varying quality. At the scale of CCA, corals attached to the preferred CCA experienced increased survivorship while recruits attached elsewhere had lower colony growth and survivorship.

Moreover, the widely conserved ability to hydrolyze animal-derived polymers, including chitin and glycogen, was lost, along with the ability to efficiently grow on a variety of amino acids. Ecological data showing associations with particulate algal material but not zooplankton further support this shift in niche preference, and the loss of motility appears to reflect a sessile macroalga-associated lifestyle.

As marine invertebrates are facing multiple stressors from overfishing and climatic stress, it is important to evaluate the conditions that facilitate recruitment in low-density populations.

Here, red abalone recruitment was evaluated annually from 2012 to 2016 and monthly from 2016 to 2017 in Central California where red abalone naturally occur in highly aggregated but low-density populations because of sea otter predation. Trends in wind-driven upwelling, temperature, wave forces, and food resources (kelp) were evaluated over the same time period as factors that could affect recruitment patterns. Recruitment was annually consistent except in 2015, when recruitment declined by 76%, likely because of reproductive failure during the second year of the North Pacific marine heat wave.

T. cornutus concentrated high levels of ARA in the visceral lipids from the dietary algae whose lipid content were very low. The viscera may effectively serve as a source of ARA for infant formulas. High levels of ARA, EPA, and n-3 DPA in the phospholipids of T. cornutus were observed. T. cornutus is a healthful marine food containing high levels of n-3 DPA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed organismal (rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion) and cellular (heat shock protein expression, anti-oxidant enzymes) responses of juvenile and adult abalone exposed to low (similar to 83% of saturation), intermediate (similar to 95% of saturation) and high (similar to 115% of saturation) oxygen levels for one month. Using the Comet assay, we measured DNA damage to determine whether the observed trends in the protective responses were sufficient to prevent oxidative damage to cells. Juveniles were unaffected by moderately hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Elevated basal rates of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase were sufficient to prevent DNA fragmentation and protein damage. Adults, with their lower basal rate of anti-oxidant enzymes, had increased DNA damage under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions, indicating that the antioxidant enzymes were unable to prevent oxidative damage under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions. The apparent insensitivity of juvenile abalone to decreased and increased oxygen might be related to their life history and development in algal and diatom biofilms where they are exposed to extreme diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen levels.

Using three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC), three fluorescent components were identified, i. e. protein -like C1, protein -like C2, and humic-like C3. Our results showed that mariculture activities dominated the DOM pool by seasonal generating abundant DOM with lower aromaticity and humification degrees. Accounting for 40 -95 % of total fluorescent components, C1 (Ex/Em = 300/340 nm) was regarded the same as D1 (Ex/Em = 300/335 nm) identified in a 180 -day degradation experiments of G. lemaneiformis detritus, indicating that the cultured seaweed modulated DOM through the seasonal production of C1. In addition, the incubation experiment revealed that 0.7 % of the total carbon content of seaweed detritus could be preserved as recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (RDOC). However, fish culture appeared to contribute to liable DOC and protein -like C2, exerting a substantial impact on DOM during winter but making a negligible contribution to carbon sequestration, while abalone culture might promote the potential export and sequestration of seaweed -derived carbon to the ocean.

Results showed that the combined exposure to homo-YTX and NO2-N increased the D and ROS levels and upregulated B -cell lymphoma -2 (BCL2)-associated X (BAX) and caspase3 (CASP3) expression levels while reducing glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and GPx, CuZnSOD, and BCL2 expression levels. High concentrations of homo-YTX (10 mu g L-1) and NO2- N (6 mg L-1) solutions and the combinations of these toxicants inhibited the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and downregulated the expression levels of MnSOD, CAT, Hsp70, and Hsp90. The ROS levels were negatively correlated with the activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx and the expression levels of MnSOD, CuZnSOD, CAT, GPx, Hsp70, Hsp90, and BCL2. These results suggest that homo-YTX, in conjunction with NO2-N, induces oxidative stress, disrupts antioxidant defense systems, and triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis in the gills of abalone.

This study is aimed at resolving the role of CCA as a settlement inducer for patellid limpets, providing insight into the influence of different CCA-related factors. The larvae of the economically valuable limpet Patella candei were used as a model. Six assays were performed: (1) different CCA assemblages, (2) exposure time, (3) artificial removal of epibionts, (4) substrate area, (5) soluble cues (CCA-conditioned seawater), and (6) substrate selection in a choice experiment. Settlers were identified by velum loss and teleoconch development. Species composition of the CCA assemblages significantly influenced settlement, with a preference for Titanoderma pustulatum and combined Neogoniolithon sp. and Hydrolithon farinosum crusts. The substrates dominated by Agissea inamoena, marginal presence of CCA or which epibionts were artificially removed, were statistically similar to those in the negative control. The ratio of settlers increased until 4 days of exposure, after which it remained stable over time. The results support that CCA releases soluble cues with settlement-inducing effect on P. candei larvae, explaining why the ratio of settlers increased with substrate area. The choice experiment suggests that P. candei larvae have limited selectivity with respect to the substrate surface. In conclusion, the present study points to the relevance of CCA assemblages as settlement substrates for limpet larvae, with an impact on limpet recruitment in the wild as well as on the production of post-larvae for limpet aquaculture.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:001097232200001,

Rates of grazing by fish on tropical coral reefs and by sea urchins on temperate rocky reefs are usually high, but can be low in areas of extreme water motion. Some herbivores can switch between mobile (grazing) and sedentary (drift-feeding) behaviours, and this can be influenced by water motion. We compared the relative consumption of the kelp Ecklonia radiata at rocky reefs in western Australia with different wave exposures (inshore versus offshore). No herbivory was recorded offshore, suggesting that wave exposure might inhibit herbivory, We also compared grazing by fish and sea urchins, and grazing versus drift-feeding pathways. Grazing by fish and sea urchins was low, except at one inshore reef where grazing by fish was intense. In contrast, drift-feeding by sea urchins was recorded at all inshore reefs, suggesting that this is a ubiquitous behaviour in the region. We measured productivity of E. radiata to determine if spatial patterns in rates of herbivory matched those of productivity. Productivity of E. radiata was higher on offshore reefs at one location. The observed difference in consumption between inshore and offshore reefs at both locations suggests that consumption is not limited by productivity, but by exposure. Further, the high productivity offshore combined with low rates of herbivory suggest that offshore reefs might be a source of kelp that subsidises other habitats.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000263999900017,

Emergent larvae were more susceptible than encapsulated larvae. The egg capsule appears to provide an effective barrier to decadienal exposure.

Its high economic value and vulnerability to exploitation has triggered the interest in the development of its aquaculture. Significant progress has been made in recent years, with the establishment of artificial fertilization and larval production protocols. However, there are at least two major challenges that need to be addressed before a commercial production can be achieved: larval settlement and juvenile grow-out. The aim of this research was to study the effect of different algae substrates (Ulvella lens, Amphora sp., Entomoneis sp., Navicula salinicola and Nitzschia sp.) on P. aspera settlement and to test the effect of two diets on juvenile growth: a mono diet based on U. lens versus a mixed diet composed by U. lens and the diatoms Nitzschia sp. and Navicula salinicola. Results showed that U. lens was the most efficient settlement cue, given that 84.6% of the post-larvae obtained were found on this algae substrate. In the following trial, U. lens was selected as the base diet for the grow-out phase. The rearing system used ensured juvenile survival percentages above 80%. The regular supply of the diatom mixture, as a dietary supplement, significantly enhanced juvenile growth performance.

The stomach, including digestive glands, was the major digestive organ for both carbohydrate and protein. The optimum conditions for amylase activity were 40 degrees C and pH 7; for acidic proteinases they were 60 degrees C and pH 5. Two main alkaline proteinases were found in the intestine, with optimum conditions of 30 degrees C and pH 8 and 60 degrees C and pH 8. To improve mussel survival by finding suitable phytoplankton species and age as food for juveniles and adults, an in-vitro digestibility test was performed on ten algal species three and seven days old using amylase and proteinases in crude enzyme extracts from different mussel life stages. Among the phytoplankton selected, the three most efficiently digested by juveniles were seven-day-old Chlorella sp.2, seven-day-old Chlorococcum sp. and seven-day-old Kirchneriella incurvata, in the ratio 1:1:3 for 30-day-old juveniles and 3:1:1 for 130-day-old juveniles. For the adult mussel, three-day-old Chlorella sp.2, seven-day-old Coccomyxa sp., and seven-day-old Monoraphidium sp., in the ratio 3:1:1, were the most digestible phytoplankton.

In the widely invasive marine species Crepidula fornicata (L.), adult conditioned seawater is an effective inducer but the inducer has not yet been chemically characterized. In the present study, we experimentally tested the inductive ability of dibromomethane (DBM), a halogenated compound naturally-produced by red algae of the family Corallinaceae that co-occur with C. fornicata in the field. Through a series of three experiments, we demonstrated that DBM effectively induces metamorphosis of C. fomicata larvae, with a strong dose response effect. Positive responses were observed for the four tested concentrations (5, 50, 500 and 5000 ppm), 5000 ppm being the most effective at inducing rapid metamorphosis. At this concentration, larvae became responsive at least five days before they became responsive to excess KCl, a chemical commonly used to test for competence in C fornicata. Whether DBM could be an effective natural inducer would require further studies to quantify DBM and other halogenated compounds in the vicinity of C. fornicata beds, where they could influence larval behaviour even in the absence of other settlement cues.

Settlement and metamorphosis are key processes influencing the natural recruitment and aquaculture production of aquatic organisms. Recruitment requirements in limpets (Patellogastropoda) are mostly unknown, because of the lack of reliable settlement inducers. Aims. This study tested the reliability of different cues as settlement inducers for competent larvae of the economically valuable Patella aspera. Methods. Natural crustose coralline algae (CCA) and biofilms of the benthic diatom Navicula salinicola were tested as positive controls. The following four pharmacological agents were tested as chemical inducers in a wide range of concentrations: gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine (ACH), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and potassium chloride (KCl). Settlers were identified by the velum loss and teleoconch development. Key results. CCA were strong settlement cues in all the assays. Contrary to previous hypotheses, GABA was a weak inducer with a peak effect at 10(-5) M. Neither the diatom biofilms nor the other pharmacological agents (ACH, IBMX and KCl) promoted the settlement response. All pharmacological agents at high concentrations influenced larval behaviour. Conclusions. CCA were reliable positive controls and settlement inducers for the production of post-larvae.

In California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico), overfishing and climate change-linked diseases are thought to be responsible for mass mortalities and significant declines in abalone fisheries landings. Conservation aquaculture is an option for enhancing abalone populations through captive propagation and cage mariculture with subsequent restockings into the wild. To test, inform, and promote innovative sustainable seafood production strategies in the Northeastern Pacific, we designed an experimental mariculture system at San Jeronimo Island, Baja California. We explored the feasibility of rearing juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, in a near-shore mariculture cage-based production system to supply individuals for local restoration programs. We tested the effects of 2 different depths, surface and bottom (5 m), and 3 macroalgal diets (Macrocystis pyrifera, Eisenia arborea, and a mixed diet of Pelagophycus porra with M. pyrifera) on the survival and growth of juvenile red abalone (32 +/- 3.33 mm in shell length) inside cages attached to a long-line system. Over the 90-d experiment, survival was 99% for the surface treatment and 95% for the bottom treatment. Mean daily increment in shell length was 93 +/- 12 mu m.d(-1) in surface cages and 82 +/- 13 mu m.d(-1) in bottom cages. Depth did not affect growth or survival. Growth was highest using the E. arborea diet (99 +/- 7 mu m.d(-1)) but not significantly different from the M. pyrifera and mixed diets (88 +/- 10 and 74 +/- 13 mu m.d(-1), respectively). High survivorship and growth indicate that San Jeronimo Island can support cage-based mariculture of red abalone and that this strategy may be a useful tool in developing climate-resilient abalone restoration solutions aimed at bolstering seafood production.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000611020400012,

It also takes part in the host immune defense mainly via its ability to bind to iron (III) ions. Hence, transferrin is also identified as an important acute-phase protein in host immunity. Abalones are major shellfish aquaculture crops that are susceptible to a range of marine microbial infections. Since transferrin is known to be a major player in innate immunity, in the present study we sought to identify, and molecularly and functionally characterize a transferrin-like gene from disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) named as AbTrf. AbTrf consisted of a 2187-bp open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a 728 amino acid (aa) protein. The putative amino acid sequence of AbTrf harbored N- and C-terminal transferrin-like domains, active sites for iron binding, and conserved cysteine residues. A constitutive tissue specific AbTrf expression pattern was detected by qPCR in abalones where mantle and muscle showed high AbTrf expression levels. Three immune challenge experiments were conducted using Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes and LPS as stimuli and, subsequently, AbTrf mRNA expression levels were quantified in gill and hemocytes in a time-course manner. The mRNA expression was greatly induced in both tissues in response to both challenges. Evidencing the functional property of transferrins, recombinant AbTrf N-terminal domain (AbTrf-N) showed dose-dependent iron (III) binding activity detected by chrome azurol S (CAS) assay system. Moreover, recombinant AbTrf-N could significantly inhibit the growth of iron-dependent bacterium, Escherichia coli in a dose-dependent manner. However, AbTrf-N was unable to show any detectable bacteriostatic activity against iron-independent bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) even at its highest concentration.

This study explores relationships between urchins and macroalgae in transition-zone kelp forests along the western side of False Bay. Six kelp forests in this region were sampled. At each site, the urchin Parechinus angulosus and kelp Ecklonia maxima were counted, percentage cover of understorey algae was recorded, and drift algae were collected. Despite variability in urchin and algal cover across sites, kelps generally increased from north to south, while urchins did the opposite. Urchins were negatively associated with macroalgae, although this relationship was weak. A localised threshold of 50 urchins m(-2) was identified, above which kelp density failed to increase above 10 m(-2) and percentage cover of understorey algae usually remained below 20%. Surprisingly, no relationship was discovered between drift algae and attached algae. The findings highlight the complexity of these cool-water environments. To better understand the role of urchins in this system, particularly under changing climate trends, experimental research into the feeding behaviour and possible effects of urchins on attached algae in the presence/absence of drift algae is advised.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000454154300005,

"Roberts, R","Roberts, R",A review of settlement cues for larval abalone (Haliotis spp.),2001,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,20,2,,571,586,,,"Settlement of abalone larvae involves larval attachment (a reversible behavior) followed by metamorphosis (which involves irreversible physical changes), Coralline algae induce attachment and metamorphosis in all abalone species tested, and there is some evidence of settlement preferences for certain coralline species. The settlement-inducing chemicals from corallines have not been identified, In one case (Haliotis rufescens) a small peptide is implicated, while in another (Haliotis discus hannai) halomethanes are thought to be critical. Corallines are generally regarded as unsuitable for use in hatcheries, but their potential use has not been fully evaluated. Many abalone hatcheries rely on biofilms to induce larval settlement. The activity of biofilms increases with their age. Ungrazed films are generally dominated by fast-growing benthic diatoms, and settlement on these films is variable and often low. Few diatom strains are consistently good for settlement, and strains that are excessively mobile, or form 3-dimensional colonies, can prevent successful settlement. The chemistry of settlement induction by biofilms, and the role that bacteria play, are poorly understood. Bacteria can induce settlement, but metamorphosis occurs gradually over several days, if at all. Pregrazing by conspecific abalone improves the settlement-inducing activity of a biofilm. The mucus from the foot of grazers probably contains chemicals (not identified) that trigger attachment or metamorphosis, particularly when combined with another cue (such as dibromomethane or a biofilm). Various pure chemicals induce attachment and/or metamorphosis of abalone larvae. These may bind to larval receptors (e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acid = GABA) or act downstream of, or parallel to, the receptors (e.g., compounds that depolarize membranes or alter levels of cyclic AMP or calcium). None of these chemicals is considered to be a natural settlement cue, and only GABA has been used in abalone hatcheries. The timing and end point of the abalone settlement response vary among cues, and among abalone species. Cues can combine synergistically to enhance settlement (e.g., GABA with lysine, biofilm or coralline extract, dibromomethane with mucus). Signal reception pathways are known only for the case of Haliotis rufescens and GABA-mimetic inducers. The response is controlled through a morphogenetic pathway, which is subject to up- and down-regulation by molecules acting on a separate regulatory pathway. Larval attachment and metamorphosis are often uncoupled in abalone. Cues for attachment are much more widespread than cues for metamorphosis.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000173758900003,

However, few studies have assessed how CCA respond to low emission scenarios or conditions. In a laboratory experiment, we examined the responses of temperate CCA assemblages to combined warming and acidification projected under low, medium, and high emissions. Net calcification and net photosynthesis significantly declined in all emissions scenarios, while significant reductions in relative growth rates and increases in percentage bleaching were observed in the highest emission scenario. The negative responses of CCA to both low and medium emissions suggest that they may be adversely impacted by combined warming and acidification by 2030 if current emissions are sustained. This will have far reaching consequences for commercially important invertebrates that rely on them to induce settlement of larvae.

Therefore, habitats that can support dense concentrations of large abalone would be better suited for aggregation rebuilding projects. Several experimental rebuilding projects are currently underway; the experimental sites were, in general, selected based on abalone presence and relative abundance. This study attempts to describe abalone habitat suitable for rebuilding efforts by using data from surveys completed at the start of the large decline of abalone densities observed in British Columbia (BC). Several areas were surveyed to determine abalone density on the southeast coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the north central mainland coast of BC between 1978 and 1980. Habitat data were recorded after each dive, including substrate types and dominant algae cover and species. Four categories of algal types were analyzed based on height and growth patterns: (1) canopy; (2) understorey (large bottom cover); (3) turf (short bottom cover); and (4) encrusting. In addition, an index of wave exposure was also calculated for each site surveyed. Northern abalone density was inversely correlated to mean abalone shell lengths. The exposure index was correlated positively to abalone density but negatively to mean shell length. Regression tree classifications successfully separated habitats of high and low abalone densities, but these differed from habitats classified using mean shell length as the response variable. To optimize rebuilding efforts, a compromise between the two classification models, one with density as the response variable and the other with mean shell length, may have to be developed.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000249504700002,

H. iris did, however, avoid sediments by moving from predation refugia beneath cobbles to vertical surfaces on cobble edges significantly more often in sediment treatments compared to sediment-free controls. Deposited sediments were also found to inhibit righting response, key behaviour in allowing H. iris to reattach to the substratum following dislodgement.

In the present study, we determined the general properties and partial amino acid sequences of alginate lyases from three Archeogastropoda, i.e., Haliotis discus hannai, H. iris, and Omphalius rusticus, and one Mesogastropoda, i.e., Littorina brevicula, in order to enrich the information about functional and structural diversity in gastropod alginate lyases. The alginate lyases were extracted from hepatopancreas of these animals and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by conventional column chromatography. Single alginate lyases with molecular masses of approximately 28, 34, and 34 kDa were isolated from H. discus, H. iris, and O. rusticus, respectively. While three alginate lyases with molecular masses of 35, 32, and 28 kDa were isolated from L. brevicula. These enzymes were identified as poly(M) lyase (EC 4.2.2.3) since they preferably degraded poly(M)-rich substrate. Western blot analysis using an antiserum raised against H. discus enzyme suggested that H. iris, and O. rusticus enzymes shared similar primary/higher-order structure with H. discus enzyme, but the L. brevicula enzymes did not. H. discus, H. iris, and O. rusticus enzymes were classified to polysaccharide-lyase family-14 by the analysis of partial amino acid sequences, while the L. brevicula enzymes were not.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000265704600025,

Here, we examine ontogenetic variability in the habitat associations of black-foot abalone (Haliotis iris) populations in central New Zealand to better understand links between habitat variability and demographic variability in abalone. At larger, regional scales, there were west-to-east gradients in juvenile abundance, adult abundance and the size at which H. iris begin to occupy open reef habitats. At smaller, local scales, populations were depth-stratified, and there were two prominent transitions: a deep-to-shallow habitat transition during the juvenile stages; and a shallow-to-deep habitat transition during the adult stages. We also found that associations between abalone abundance and the size of the boulders, as well as associations between abalone abundance and the surface area of the interstitial spaces between boulders, differ among ontogenetic stages. For all stages, abundance was positively associated with crustose coralline algae cover, but negatively associated with articulated coralline algae cover. The relationship between canopy algae and adult abundance was positive, whereas for early juveniles, late juveniles and subadults, the relationship was weakly negative. Last, the association between the cover of understorey algae and abundance was negative for all ontogenetic stages.

In this study, the effects of 4 typical harmful algae species present in Chinese waters (Karenia mikimotoi, Alexandrium catenella, Aureococcus anophagefferens, and Prorocentrum donghaiense) on the survival and metamorphosis of abalone Haliotis discus hannai larvae were investigated. After 96 h of treatment, un-metamorphosed larvae (veligers) were significantly affected by K. mikimotoi, A. catenella, and P. donghaiense, as mean +/- SD survival rates were 5.2 +/- 2.1, 27.7 +/- 1.4, and 63.8 +/- 6.9%, respectively, compared with 86.0 +/- 4.1% for the control treatment (the non-toxic alga Skeletonema costatum).

At present, 100% of Chile's abalone enterprises farm the H. rufescens species, owing to its suitability for full-cycle culture. In the analysis of factors that facilitate the development of abalone farming in Chile, those that stand out include the characteristics of the aquatic ecosystem, existing entrepreneurial and professional skills, decisive government support in co-financing scientific and technological projects, infrastructure and associated services to support these development initiatives and a market where prices have remained stable and demand for abalone products has been steady. The greatest challenges facing intensive abalone farming in Chile are providing a constant supply of macroalgae for abalone feed and developing complementary feed, as well as updating current legislation on intensive abalone farming, strengthening producer associations and establishing health certification. The article discusses examples of the impact that native organisms can have on animals introduced into an aquatic ecosystem and the international transmission of agents such as withering syndrome and sabellid polychaete infestation disease, associated with the movement of abalone seeds and broodstock.

The genus was first reported in Korea in 1892, and to date, a total of six species has been recognized in Korea using a traditional taxonomic morphology-based approach. Nevertheless, there have been disagreements regarding the presence of some of these species, and the paucity of genetic studies undertaken on this group in Korea to date has hindered efforts to close this gap in knowledge. To address this, we conducted an extensive sampling of specimens of Padina across the southern half of the Korean peninsula and neighboring islands. Molecular analyses revealed the presence of four Padina species: P. arborescens, P. crassa, P. imbricata (recorded in Korea for the first time), and P. japonica. Our study, in conjunction with prior research, confirmed the distinctiveness of P. crassa and P. gymnospora, leading us to propose the reinstatement of P. crassa as a separate species. The four identified species in Korea have a dual origin: while P. arborescens, P. crassa, and P. imbricata have historical origins in the East Pacific, P. japonica originated from the Central Indo-Pacific. The genetic divergence and time of divergence observed between these species and the American lineages/species suggests that they are not the result of introduction but rather historical natural dispersal, likely facilitated by oceanic currents. These findings allowed concluding that the four species found in Korea are indigenous to this region. The genus Padina exhibits vast potential for various applications briefly reviewed here, and we strongly advocate for its commercial utilization in Korea. Particularly, P. arborescens, which showed promising pharmaceutical properties and can dominate the seabed in parts of the Korean coast, warrants special attention in this regard.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:001218593600001,

Laboratory experiments showed that competent veliger larvae (4 days after fertilization) had a radula and regularly added rows of radular teeth with age in the absence of metamorphosis. Under environmentally relevant temperatures (17-22 degrees C), the number of rows of radular teeth increased linearly with age.. but slopes of the regression lines were different among temperatures. Rows of radular teeth were added more slowly at lower temperatures. The effect of temperature on the development rate of the radula was quantified by the regression and the temperature coefficient, Q(10). The radular development of newly metamorphosed post-larvae, which had not acquired a peristomal shell (adult shell), was comparable with that of veliger larvae, although older post-larvae had a larger number of rows of radula than those of the same age of veliger larvae. From these results, an age determination method of veliger larvae and newly metamorphosed post-larvae was established, using the number of rows of radular teeth. The age of veliger larvae and newly metamorphosed post-larvae was determined by the age determination method for samples collected in August to October of 2003 and 2004 for which the thermal history of the coastal water of Miyagi Prefecture Japan was available.

For successful fisheries management it is essential to understand drivers of population variability. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the cultural keystone, pa over bar ua (Haliotis iris, blackfoot abalone) has undergone considerable stock declines, and stock enhancement efforts have had limited success. Multiple regression modelling, and generalised linear modelling were used to assess drivers of H. iris size and density at 50 sites around southern New Zealand.

This study highlights that fishing restrictions may not lead to an increase in population size, and that declines of cultural keystone species may have intergenerational impacts. Therefore, it is essential to empower local communities supporting management of reefs at small scales and very conservative catch levels to maintain the broad values of this species in customary protection areas while fisheries rebuilding occurs.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:001003407500001,

The use of suspension-feeders (e.g. bivalves) in biofiltration systems provides an inexpensive option for the biological removal of these nutrients from effluent water. Land-based facilities are safer because the quality of the incoming water can be controlled, and integrated polyculture systems can save resources, diversify the product, allow intensification, and are environmentally friendly, thus offering a valid alternative to open sea monoculture. Several approaches have been developed to reach this goal. These approaches are based on the use of algae and invertebrates as biofilters, which remove the dissolved and particulate nutrients from fishpond effluents. Sunlight-dependent assimilation turns excess nutrients into microalgae biomass, which is then consumed with other organic particulate matter by the invertebrates. These systems consist of three units: a) a fish or shrimp culture unit, b) an earthen pond that serves as both a microalgal production and a bivalve culture unit, and c) a seaweed biofilter unit. Microalgae, especially benthic diatoms, are responsible for most of the nutrient uptake. The main cultured herbivores are filter-feeding bivalves, which grow in the earthen pond. The seaweed biofilter strips the remaining dissolved nutrients from the effluents. The harvested yields (fish, bivalve and seaweed) contain 63% of the nitrogen introduced into the system, particulate matter (faeces and uneaten feed) contain 33%, and suspended and dissolved outflow, approximately 4% of the nitrogen budget. More complex systems require highly skilled operators and more sophisticated technology, but they provide increased product diversity. Depending on practical factors such as market prices, quality and cost of labor, seed and fingerlings supply, environmental conditions, market size and property cost, the operational protocol can be shifted between the three product types (fish, algae and invertebrates) to maximize profits.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000232685200011,

A high proportion of veliger larvae had the ability to prolong the searching phase of settlement and delay metamorphosis, even over prepared settlement surfaces but radula development continued at a similar rate in both settled and swimming larvae. In any one batch of larvae settlement was slow and asynchronous and post-settlement survival was low. Light was shown to influence the swimming behaviour of larvae in settlement tanks, with more larvae swimming in the dark than in the light. The implications of these behaviours are discussed in relation to larval and postlarval energetics and feeding.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000083585800012,

We investigated the roles of light spectrum, nutrient availability, and culture conditions on the laboratory production of Cocconeis scutellum scutellum Ehrenb. and C. scutellum parva Grunow. Diatoms were cultivated in petri dishes, and inverted optical microscopy was used to periodically record their abundance. Growth curves were constructed from these data for each culture condition. In addition, at the end of the experiment we performed weight measurements to determine the total production for each of the considered conditions. We found that cultivation in nonsealed (NS) petri dishes (permitting gas exchange) represented the most productive technique. Cell density and biomass varied among light spectra, although this effect was inconsistent. For example, the Sylvania Gro-Lux lamp (GL) produced the lowest cell density but highest biomass, suggesting that it may promote the production of larger cells. Surprisingly, of the culture media tested, 172 (a media commonly used for the culture of diatoms) was the least productive. Diatom density and biomass were variably dependent on the combination of experimental culture conditions and strain used. These physical and chemical factors act mainly on given features of the diatom growth curve. These results permitted us to devise adequate culture protocols, to produce a biotechnologically important substance: a proapoptotic compound that specifically destroys the androgenic gland of a shrimp and could find novel applications in human medicine.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000297880500022,

There are, however, several constraints to consider throughout much of the Pacific, including, transport problems, fragile ecosystems, lack of suitable sites, limited economies, and the effects of customary marine tenure on access to growout sites. To overcome these problems, coastal aquaculture in the Pacific will need to focus either on species of high value, or those that yield non-perishable products. Valuable industries have been established for pearl oysters, penaeid shrimps, and the microalgae, Spirulina, in tropical Australia, the French territories and Hawaii, whereas enterprises for cultured giant clams, milkfish (Chanos chanos) as tuna bait, the macroalgae, Eucheuma, and sponges are emerging in the small island developing states. Species demanded by the aquarium trade, groupers for live reef fish markets, tropical abalone (Haliotidae), mangrove crabs (Scylla spp.) and a variety of invertebrates as sources of bioactive compounds are promising new species for intensive farming. Aquaculture technology is being applied to the restocking and stock enhancement of valuable, sedentary species low in the food chain, and there are active programmes in several small island developing states to assess the scope for releasing cultured giant clams, trochus, green snail and sea cucumbers to replenish and enhance wild stocks. There is a growing awareness that the potential benefits of increased aquaculture, restocking and stock enhancement need to be balanced by the risks associated with culturing additional species, i.e. introduction of diseases, dilution of gene pools and increased biological interactions with other species, and that sustainable aquaculture, restocking and stock enhancement are most likely to be achieved with responsible application of technology and the use of indigenous species.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000083692200001,

A 15-month field experiment was conducted in the Bahamas to compare the survival, growth, morphology, and behavior of hatchery-reared and wild juvenile conch (85-120 mm shell length). Two experimental sites were established. Site C1 contained a resident conch population whereas few conch occurred naturally at site C2. Survival was higher for wild conch than for hatchery-reared conch. After 7 months, 28% of the original wild conch were recovered compared with only 9% of the hatchery-reared conch. Thin shells, short spines, and low burial frequency in hatchery-reared conch may have caused them to be more vulnerable to predators. In a tethering experiment, about twice as many hatchery conch were killed as wild conch, but the difference was not significant inside enclosures. Survivorship was higher at the site with resident juveniles, probably because of density-dependent protection from predation. After a period of high mortality in free-ranging conch during the first two months, tag recovery curves for both stock types reached a plateau. Also, near the end of the study, shell characteristics of wild and hatchery conch were identical as was survivorship. Analysis of movement patterns indicated that both stock types moved toward the natural population center. Although survivorship was higher at the site with resident conch, growth rates for both stock types were often lower at this site. Algal foods may have been more abundant at the site without conch because of lower grazing pressure. Although highest mean daily growth occurred at 1.0 conch.m-2, growth rates of conch enclosed at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 individuals.m-2 were not significantly different in most cases. Growth rates were higher for wild conch than for hatchery conch. In summer, free-ranging and tethered wild conch grew twice as fast as hatchery-reared conch.

It is often assumed that inducers associated with CCA are algal in origin, but an alternative hypothesis is that they originate from bacteria on the algal surface. Because many species manifest specificity in settling on CCA, a necessary condition of the hypothesis of bacterial origin is that bacterial assemblages on CCA are distinctive. Bacteria isolated from surfaces of 2 South African species of CCA (Sporolithon sp. and Clathromorphum sp.), 2 seawater samples collected adjacent to the CCA, and ground-glass slides incubated next to the corallines were examined for 34 morphological and physiological characters. Bacteria from the 2 CCA were distinct from those from other microhabitats and from each other, whereas isolates from the 2 seawater samples were similar, and those from glass slides were more similar to seawater populations than to coralline-associated bacteria. Bacteria from corallines were distinguished by narrower temperature ranges for growth, and in general, inability to (1) utilize glucose, (2) hydrolyse complex carbohydrates and urea, (3) utilize simple amino acids, and (4) reduce nitrate. These characteristics and the distributions of bacteria on crust surfaces suggest that epiphytic bacteria may utilise compounds from the algae for growth. Bacteria on Sporolithon sp. grew mostly from within recently damaged cells, whereas on Clathromorphum sp. they proliferated on a mucus-like matrix on its surface. For some strains the association of bacteria with host alga may be specialised. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of bacterial origin of inducers associated with CCA, but they do not provide a critical test and thus do not resolve the question of algal or bacterial origin of inducers. In examining both hypotheses, we suggest methods to critically discern among these 2 alternatives. There was no trace of free GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) or L-DOPA (L-beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) in cell-free extracts of either species of South African coralline algae or in bacteria isolated from the corallines and the other microhabitats.

The model was parameterized using field and laboratory data, and predictions were quantitatively compared with field-measured tissue Zn concentrations obtained from selected abalone farms. Based on the reliable information from the published literature, we assigned the lognormal distribution model to characterize model inputs. Input variables included bioconcentration factor (BCF) of abalone, biomagnification factor of abalone, BCF of algae and depuration rate constants of abalone (k(2)) for Zn from water and food. Compared with the field data, most of the measurements fall within the predicted 25th and 75th percentile range, indicating applying Monte Carlo technique to the first-order two-compartment model generated probabilistic estimates of Zn concentrations in abalone and algae that were consistent with field observations. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the input critical parameters that most influence the model output are BCF and k(2) of abalone. Our results suggest that the probabilistic approach allows a range of possible outcomes and their likelihood; it better informs both aquacultural risk assessors and risk managers. The degree of conservatism in the deterministic bioaccumulation models can also be evaluated against this distribution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

GABA was not detectable in extracts of crustose red algae (CRA) which are the preferred settlement substratum for Haliotis larvae. The CRA surfaces and their associated biofilms did not produce GABA from glutamate, and GABA production from putrescine required gabaculine (transaminase inhibitor). The GABA-degrading activity on the CRA surfaces was removed by surface-sterilisation. It ranged from 0.45 to 1.12 nmol cm(-2) h(-1) with insignificant seasonal variation. Removal of grazing molluscs from CRA-covered stones led to the growth of a visible biofilm and markedly increased GABA degradation in 2 weeks. Within a few days of placing clean, sterile glass surfaces in the settlement environment, biofilms with GABA-degrading activity developed, and after 11 weeks incubation,the GABA degradation rate on glass marbles was 0.37 nmol cm(-2) h(-1). GABA was not completely oxidised, and the products of GABA metabolism showed similar chromatographic behaviour to alanine and glutamate. In the typical New Zealand Haliotis settlement habitat, GABA is not likely to play a significant role as an inducer of abalone larval settlement because on the preferred settlement surfaces it is not readily produced from its precursors but it is easily degraded.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:A1995RQ45700007,

Explanations include the following; (1) In the absence of larger grazers, prostrate diatoms that are preferentially consumed by abalone recruits become displaced by less suitable overstorey diatoms, filamentous algae or blue-green algae; (2) textured corallines protect pockets of suitable diatoms, whereas large grazers eliminate these from smooth corallines. We tested these possibilities in aquarium experiments in which microalgal communities were grown on artificial coralline mimics with different textures and then exposed to different grazers at densities simulating those in the field. Microalgal standing stocks (measured as chlorophyll a) increased in the absence of grazers, but this was reflected only in the amounts of filamentous and blue-green algae. Diatoms remained unchanged in quantity and community composition between different grazing treatments and substratum textures. Changes in diatom communities following urchin removal are thus unlikely to explain the ensuing disappearance of abalone recruits, although changes in filamentous and blue-green algae may do so. Textured surfaces did, however, consistently support higher stocks of microalgae than smooth surfaces (in either the presence or the absence of grazers), which may account for the preference of abalone recruits for irregular encrusting corallines in the field.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000180374300010,

The solar dryer achieved a greater degree of moisture evaporation than open-air drying (86.1% versus 67.6%, respectively). This result is directly associated with the recorded peaks in air temperature (41.3 degrees C in the solar dryer versus 21.7 degrees C outside of the solar dryer). The specific energy consumption required for the optimized solar dryer process was 1.64 kWh/kg, as due to the energy requirements of the air fan and recirculation pump. Solar drying is very effective in drying G. chilensis when parameters are optimized. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:000435620100085,

Understanding how species respond to such changes, such as in their feeding interactions and physiology, is key to predicting their resilience to both seasonal and longer term climate changes. The Sitka Sound in Southeast Alaska, USA, is an attractive natural laboratory for studying change, as the marine environment experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations in parameters such as temperature, pH, and productivity between summer and winter. By sampling a suite of dominant macrophyte algae and their benthic herbivores in winter (January) and summer (July) 2019, we investigated how producers and their primary consumers may respond to seasonal change inferred through fatty acid trophic markers. We used a fatty acid logratio selection and analysis approach to ask the following: (1) Do fatty acid biomarkers for algae differ between seasons? (2) Do the same fatty acid biomarkers differ between seasons when applied to herbivores, with herbivore fatty acids tracking the presumed trophic resources? (3) Do fatty acid biomarkers for herbivores differ between seasons, when considered independently from algae? Comparing logratio sets selected each for the algae and the herbivore fatty acids, we found that algae fatty acids were different between our sampling seasons, but the algae-selected fatty acid logratios did not clearly separate most herbivores by season. In contrast, the herbivore-selected logratios strongly distinguished herbivore species between the January and June samplings. Further, dispersions of fatty acid logratios were greater within herbivore species in the winter than in the summer, potentially due to the utilization of more diverse resources when preferred algae are less abundant. In total, results suggest that herbivores are not simply tracking the seasonal fatty acid changes in the dominant algae as trophic resources; instead, herbivore fatty acid seasonal changes may occur largely through some other nonexclusive mechanisms, such as omnivory, reductions or shifts in dietary composition, and/or endogenous physiological responses. Thus, the benthic herbivores in our study appear not to be locked into their diets when faced with seasonal change and may use a range of strategies, including diet diversification, to cope with environmental variation.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:001395779900001,

Abalones are an important marine fishery resource and of cultural importance to Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. A highly priced marine delicacy, they are inherently vulnerable: individuals are slow-growing and long-lived and successful reproduction requires dense assemblages. However, their global conservation status is poorly understood. Using IUCN Red List methodology, we assessed the extinction risk to all 54 species of abalone (genus Haliotis). Of the 21 fished commercially for human consumption either now and/or in the past, 15 (71.43%) are classified as threatened, i.e., those identified as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable. Of the 33 unexploited species, only five (15.15%) are so classified, making exploited species over four times more likely to face extinction, underscoring the impact of fishing on abalones already confronting a changing climate. The highest concentration of threatened species occurs along the North American Pacific coast. Here six of the seven species have been exploited, yet despite years of fishery closures with exemptions only in Alaska and Mexico, all are categorised as threatened. Climate driven stressors have led to mass mortalities, with competition from sea urchins and disease, aggravated by harmful algal blooms. In Australia the picture is mixed despite robust stock management, with some regions experiencing mass mortalities from marine heatwaves and viral spread. Poaching has reached its apogee in South Africa, where organised criminal gangs have reduced the legal fishery of Haliotis midae, 'perlemoen' almost to a footnote, accompanied by widespread recruitment failure. In response, the authorities have focused on abalone ranching and stock enhancement. In Japan, with a long history of abalone fishing, wild stocks are routinely supplemented with hatchery-bred juveniles. Collaboration between restoration aquaculture and fisheries, including sea urchin control and kelp restoration, offers hope for rebuilding stocks against a backdrop of escalating environmental stressors.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:001400361000060,

Land-based aquaculture of red seaweed typically employ tumble culture systems, where compressed air is delivered to the bottom of the tank to provide gas exchange and promote mixing. However, aeration is a potentially costly process because compressed air must be bubbled into the liquid, and power is required to drive the air compressor. In this study, fundamental relationships between aeration rate, biomass productivity, and aeration power consumption were developed for tumble tank cultivation of the red seaweed Pacific dulse under CO2-replete growth conditions. The biomass productivity (g biomass L-1 d-1) of D. mollis in tumble culture was measured over seven weekly harvest cycles over a range of aeration rates (0.086-0.684 L air L-1 liquid min-1) for fine-bubble (1-5 mm) and coarse-bubble (2-3 cm) aerators, and then correlated to the CO2 transfer rate (CO2-TR, mmol CO2 L-1 h-1). The CO2-TR consolidated aeration rate, CO2 partial pressure, boundary layer diffusion, and gas sparger characteristics (bubble size, interfacial area) into a single parameter. This analysis required measurements of the gas-to-liquid mass transfer coefficient (kLa) for estimation of CO2-TR, and pressure drop across the gas diffuser for aeration power consumption. CO2-replete biomass productivity required a CO2-TR that was three times the CO2 demand. For fine-bubble aeration, both CO2-TR and aeration power consumption were higher than for coarse-bubble aeration over the range of aeration rates tested. However, when the aeration rate needed to achieve CO2-replete biomass productivity was approached, fine-bubble aeration required less energy consumption due to lower aeration requirement. The optimum was achieved at an aeration rate of 0.26 L air L-1 culture min-1 using fine-bubble aeration, which provided an areal biomass productivity of 490 g FW m- 2 d-1 (fresh mass) or 32 g AFDW m- 2 d-1 (ash-free dry mass), at an aeration energy power requirement of 1.5 kWh/kg FW (22 kWh/kg AFDW). Overall, this study showed that aeration systems can easily limit biomass productivity and result in high aeration energy consumption per kg of biomass produced if the aeration processes are not thoughtfully considered. The key tradeoff was that aeration energy consumption increased significantly as CO2-replete biomass productivity was approached. Therefore, optimization would require the use of an aerator system that provides the best possible kLa and lowest pressure drop at the lowest possible aeration rate.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:001178168700001,

Tetrasporangia were massively induced after 2.5 months under SD conditions at 10 degrees C and completely lacking at 15 degrees C, both under SD or ambient daylength conditions, with a few tetrasporangia present at 10 degrees C and ambient daylength. Elongation rates of tagged tetrasporophytic thalli peaked from March to April in all four conditions, when the biomass densities in the outdoor tanks were close to 2.5 kg fresh weight m(-2). Under all four conditions, juvenile proliferations started to appear in June from the margins of the old fronds, and attained approximately 1 cm in length by the end of July. Approximately 80% of the tetraspores were released during the first three dark phases in a light/dark regime, and the remaining 20% during the light phases. A minimum of 10 min darkness was observed to trigger spore release. White light inhibited tetraspore release, while a similar number of spores were released in continuous red light or in the light/dark regime, although with no significant differences of spore release during subjective days and nights. Sporelings were successfully derived from the released tetraspores for mass propagation of the male gametophyte in 2000-L outdoor tanks in a greenhouse. Mass production of male gametophytic sporelings of P. palmata was completed two times by SD induction of tetrasporangia at 10 degrees C, release of spores in darkness and culturing the sporelings until they were ready to be propagated vegetatively in greenhouse tanks. One experiment lasted from January to October 2001, with spore release in June, and the second from September to April 2003, with spore release in January.

Few studies have focused on the functions of glycosyltransferases (GTs) and glycoside hydrolases (GHs) involved in saccharometabolism, including that of agar. To investigate the possible functions of glycosyltransferase family 7 (GT7) and glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16) members in agar metabolism, analyses of these gene families were conducted using bioinformatics-based and physiological methods. In total, five GlGT7 genes and four GlGH16 genes from the Gp. lemaneiformis genome were identified and analyzed. These GT7 and GH16 members are absent in higher plants, and the majority of GlGT7s and GlGH16s have no introns. Catalytic pocket residue analysis revealed that GlGT7s may function as beta-1,4-galactosyltransferases and that GlGH16s play roles as agarases. Promoter prediction and qRT-PCR experiments verified that these genes can be regulated by light and phytohormones. GlGT7s were predicted to interact with carbohydrate sulfotransferases (STs), whereas yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays revealed no interactions between these proteins. Under heat stress, no significant difference was found in agar content; however, the expression of GlGT7s fluctuated and that of GlGH16 increased. Low nitrogen stress significantly increased the agar content, and the expression of GlGT7s increased, whereas that of GlGH16s decreased. In three cultivars of Gp. lemaneiformis, the expression of GlGT7 genes in cultivars 981 and Lulong No. 1 was upregulated relative to that in the wild type, whereas GlGH16 expression levels were significantly decreased. Fluorescence microscopy further showed that beta-1,4-galactose accumulation was consistent with increases in agar content and GlGT7 expression. Pearson correlation analysis confirmed that the expression levels of GlGT7s and GlGH16s were positively and negatively correlated with agar accumulation, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrated that GlGT7 and GlGH16 are intimately correlated with agar metabolism; in particular, GlGT7-2, GlGT7-5, and GlGH16-4 could act as molecular markers to indicate agar yield.

Hemocyte responses were assessed by flow cytometry every week for 42 days. Food deprivation was associated with a significant decrease in granulocyte size. Phagocytic activity increased in mussels exposed to the three diets, but it was more pronounced in mussels partially deprived of food (10% food intake). Mussels exposed to stressful nutritional conditions (10% and 0%) displayed significantly decreased oxidative activity from 14 days of exposure, whereas those fed on a normal diet displayed stable intracellular oxidative activity throughout the experiment. This study shows that nutritional conditions affect hemocyte morphometry and activity. Zebra mussel sensitivity to the nutritional conditions seemed low, even with total food deprivation for 42 days.

Still-water laboratory assays were performed with sterile measures in the presence and absence of an antibiotic mixture (2.5 x 10(-4) M streptomycin, 1.0 x 10(-4) M penicillin). In the absence of these antibiotics our results revealed a significant correlation between DFAA decrease rates, bacterial film development and larval metamorphosis within a 24 h assay period.

Sea otters had occupied the area for over two decades. Sea urchin density and size distribution were sampled during 1984-1986 to determine recruitment and mortality patterns. Growth rates were obtained from tetracycline-labeled individuals and changes in size-frequency modes. Periodic collections were made to examine gut contents and the relationship of diet to food availability. The interaction of recruitment and mortality resulted in a dynamic population structure. Mean densities ranged from 6.5 to 12.7 urchins 0.25 m-2. The population consisted primarily of urchins up to 40 mm in test diameter in a size distribution which changed from unimodal to bimodal and back over the 2 yr study. Mortality was temporally variable and related to test diameter. Growth rates were somewhat lower than most previous reports for the species and suggested that most of the population was made up of 1 and 2 yr-old individuals. Diet consisted largely of geniculate coralline algae, with fleshy brown algae becoming important when available as drift. This study showed high densities of small urchins can exist in a California kelp forest inhabited by sea otters, but regular recruitment may be necessary to maintain such populations.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:A1992GZ54600014,

However, there is little information on how co-cultivation impacts the planktonic and epiphytic microbiomes despite their important roles in nutrient cycling and seaweed health. In the present study conducted in Ailian Bay, a typical intensive mariculture area in China, the epiphytic microbiomes on Saccharina japonica and the surrounding planktonic microbiomes were assessed using cultivation-dependent and -independent techniques. The microbiomes, along with environmental parameters, were compared among different cultivation modes. Four environmental parameters (i.e., seawater temperature, salinity, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen) were significantly different between kelp mono-culture and kelp -abalone co-culture modes, with a significant increase in temperature and a significant decrease in dissolved oxygen in the coculture region. There were different alpha and beta diversity patterns regarding the two cultivation modes for fungal vs. bacterial communities, in both planktonic and epiphytic communities. The co-culture mode may help to maintain the planktonic bacterial diversity and ecological functions to make them comparable to the noculture region. This involved restoring alpha diversity, decreasing the number of differentially abundant predicted pathways, and maintaining the relative abundances of predicted pathways (such as nitrate reduction, fermentation, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, and chemoheterotrophy). Although there were fewer cultured microbes on the distal part of co-cultured compared to mono-cultured kelp, potentially pathogenic and harmful microbial pathways were significantly enriched in co-cultured kelp, indicating potential disease risks for kelp. These findings expand our knowledge of planktonic and epiphytic microbiomes under different kelp cultivation modes. Further investigation not only of nutrient cycling but also kelp disease risks in the co-culture mode is required in order to improve the co-culture mode.",View Full Record in Web of Science,WOS:001223566500001,

Data for 564 tagged and recaptured L. torquata (29-90 mm shell lengths; SL) from 7658 tagged specimens were assessed in various competing models, but the final iteration (our 'best' model) comprised eight parameters for six characteristics, including growth at 40 and 80 mm SL, growth variability, measurement errors, outliers and seasonal variation-with the two seasonal growth parameters of most interest. This model was subsequently applied separately to data available for females and males. Growth rates at the selected indicator SLs of 40 and 80 mm were 17.4 and 4.0 mm year(-1) for females and 19.1 and 4.9 mm year(-1) for males. Regardless of sex, peak growth occurred in March, coinciding with the warmest water temperature. The results imply the smaller individuals would require 2+ years to reach a current minimum legal size of 75 mm SL.

Culture conditions and algal growth influenced protoplast yields: old cultures and slowly growing parts, such as cells of the main axis, produced few protoplasts. In contrast, cell walls of meristematic regions were easily digested. Protoplasts regenerated cell walls within a few days, and after 6-7 weeks the resulting mature plants were identical with their donor specimens. Regenerates from the normal gametophytes developed mature gametangia, whereas those from the virus-infected gametophytes produced pathological symptoms upon maturity. Gametangia or infection symptoms frequently occurred very early and before the regenerates established new filaments (neoteny). In contrast to zoids, protoplasts were not infected by freshly released virus particles.

The cephalic, epipodial and mantle tentacles bear papillae with ciliary tufts at their tips. Chemoreceptors with 14-21 ciliated cells were found at high density on the snout. When the tentacles were touched with a bamboo rod or a piece of plastic sheet, the abalone contracted the tentacle stimulated, indicating mechanoreception. The contact of a piece of brown algae Laminaria japonica to any of three tentacles elicited a typical feeding response: shell lifting, pedal sole expansion and lifting, and food seizing with pedal sole. The response disappeared when the algae was separated from the tentacles, indicating that the ciliated cells were contact chemoreceptors as well as mechanoreceptors. A possibility of distant chemoreception was examined in a Y-maze in which seawater flowed over the algae and was directed towards the abalone. The algal stimulant triggered the food searching movement of the abalone which randomly chose both the stimulant containing water from the algal containing side and the control water without stimulant.

Two limpet species from Madeira fishery, Patella aspera and P. ordinaria, were used to evaluate the influence of culture vessel shape (microtubes, test tubes, centrifuge tubes, specimen cups, disposable cups, vials, flasks and beakers), composition (polypropylene and glass), volume (1.5 ml to 1.5 L) and stocking density on oocyte incubation and larval culture through nine assays. Moreover, three assays evaluated the use of microtubes and the isolation of trochophores, instead of pediveligers, for eventual settlement induction. The results showed effective hatching in most culture vessels regardless of composition or volume, except when the shape of the bottom caused oocyte clustering. Larval culture was not influenced by any variable under scrutiny (shape, composition, volume or rearing density). Microtubes were useful for settlement, while the placement of trochophores in the settling vessels, instead of pediveligers, proved inefficient and even led to failed cultures. The best settlement was obtained when the pediveligers were isolated from the water column of the beakers and transferred to clean vessels with renewed water and coralline algae as substrate.

The two baicaliids varied in the number of ingested microalgae. In addition, they exhibited significantly different efficiencies for breaking large diatoms; B. turriformis broke large diatoms into more fragments than T. ciliata.

All specimens were captured by trammel nets. As the feeding ecology of the brown wrasse is still unknown in the,southern coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, the main purpose of this paper was to provide a qualitative and quantitative description of the brown wrasse trophic behaviour. 23.33% of the investigated specimens had empty stomachs. There were no significative variation of the vacuity index depending on sex and length. The minimal values registered during the rest period showed the compensation of the energy loss. The preys were generally composed by benthic invertebrates. The major food categories are crustaceans decapods (Pagurus oculatus and Pagurus anachoretus) and molluscan gastropods (Haliotis tuberculata, Jujubinus exasperatus, Gibbula divaricata and Calliostoma laugieri). The annelid polychaetes Pontogenia chrysocoma were frequently eaten as a secondary prey species. Despite its carnivorous character, the brown wrasse also consumes algae species (Antithamnion plumula) and seagrass such as Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa. This accidental ingestion is probably due to the consumption of prey species confined in the seaweeds and the rocky substrata. The seasonal variations of the diet don't indicate any significative differences especially for the crustaceans and the molluscs groups. The secondary and complementary preys are ingested randomly. There was no relationship between dietary and length of maturity for males and females. However, only annelid group ingestion showed differences between mature and immature female diet.
